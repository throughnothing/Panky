#
#	Script
#
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours...
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Just finished our sweep. Nobody home.
Looks like somebody bagged them one of Ripley's bad guys here.
Second team, move up. Flanking positions.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Stand by for some chop.
You seeing this okay?  Looks melted.
...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left. There!
It's a bug-hunt.
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass, definitely.
...'gestates in a living human host' and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.'
May be could build a fire and sing songs.
Yes, Hicks?
Excellent.
See you soon.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...
Come here Jonesy you ugly old moose...you ugly thing.
Hudson may be right.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
None taken.
Burke...it was Burke.
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
That's right.
I told them to fall back...
Forty-two million in adjusted dollars. That's minus payload, of course.
No.. I've slept enough.
Internal pressure positive.  Assume nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep capsules, style circa late twenties...
We're getting juked!  We're gonna die in here!
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
The hearing convenes at 0930.  You don't want to be late.
No offense.
Look at this fat, juicy magnetic profile.  And it's mine, mine, mine.
They'll get us.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You always were an asshole, Gorman.
BISHOP!
Let's go!  Let's go!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Switching to DCS ranging.
Am I disturbing you conversation Mr. Hudson?
Losing fuel.
Aye-firmative!
So?  So?
Newt, put your seatbelt on!
Locked.
Why won't you check out LV-426?
I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now!
She's gone!  Let's go!
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.
Attention.  This concluded final maneuvering operations.  Thank you for your cooperation.  You may resume work.
Ferro, you copying?
First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
On my way.
Roger.
Roger.  Check back when you've activated the ship.
No.. No, he's not.  He's --
I'm all right, leave it!
Just tell me what the fuck we're supposed to do now.  What're we gonna do now?
They killed him getting it off.
I'm sorry.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!
Awright!  Let's knock off the grabass.  First assembly's in fifteen...let's shag it.
So what are these things?
It's game time.
Looks like that new Lieutenant's too good to eat with us grunts.
Oh God...
Over there.
Pull you team out, Gorman.
Sweet Jesus.
How about 'big weird thing'?
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Best decision I ever made, Bill. We'll be starting a new life from scratch, in a clean world. No crime.  No unemployment...
Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the family are heading off for the colonies!
Hold you fire!
Let's move.  Hicks, back us up.
Mommy...where are you?
Moooommeeee...
Newt!  Star wherever you are!
Rebecca.
What's her name again?
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
I need some slack, man.  How come they send us straight back out like this?  We got some slack comin', man.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
I don't get it.  It doesn't make any Goddamn sense.
It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Like I said.
They've lost contact with the colony on Acheron.
Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt.  When it came to flight schedules, anyway.
...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
I can drive that loader.  I've got a Class Two rating.  My latest career move.
It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows what he's doing.
And hope to die.
Gone.
I'll go.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.
She's right.
Holy shiiit!
I want those specimens destroyed as soon as you're done with them. You understand?
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.
Come on!
Let's waste him.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.
Burke!
Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue! 4-1-5!
Hey...hey!
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Testing!
What?
What are you doing?  Turn around!  That's an order!
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Physically she's okay. Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think any permanent damage.
More cornbread?
Poor thing.  You don't talk much do you?  That's okay by me.  Most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not saying very much.
Well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet.
Come on out.  It's all right...
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Pendejo jerkoff.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Okay, let's do it.
I think we'll take off and nuke the site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
It likes you.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
No offense.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
You're dogmeat, pal.
Are there any species like this 'hostile organism' on LV-426?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
The place is dead, Sir.  Whatever happened, we missed it.
Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill you, you useless fuck!
What's he scanning for?
Hicks, get down here.  I need that locator.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Now, if I did it right...
Go!
Close your eyes, baby.
Let's go!
You okay?
Proceed inside.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Let's get some trackers going. Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch Burke.
Let's go.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Seal the door.
Figures.
It won't be necessary.
He's at the up-link tower.
Newt, you better go sit up front.  Go on.
Where the fu --
It's insured.
They're but off!  Do something!
...We're coming in.
Anything?
Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Dumbshit.
How is he?
Just get back here!
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Not that tunnel, the other one!
They're in the approach corridor.
You sure?  Watch it...behind you.  Fucking move, will you!
You're just reading me.
Lights are green.  She's alive. Well, there goes out salvage, guys.
Negative.  We're all in Operations.
B-Level.  Next one down.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Forty meters in.  Ramp on axial two-two.  Access to sublevels.
Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
Standing by.
Who's firing?  I ordered a hold fire, dammit!
You tell me.  I only work here.
I knew you'd come.
Mommy...Mommy?
Terrible.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Talk to me, Hudson.
They're dead.
...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Thanks.
Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
The ship is on its way.  ETA about sixteen minutes.  I've got my hands full flying... the weather's come up a bit.
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
...lay down ...by squads to...
Yes, I read you.  Not very well...
I always keep this handy. For close encounter.
Any movement?
Half mine, dear.
Knock it off!  I catch either of you playing in the air ducts again I'll tan your hides.
Mayday!  Mayday!  This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control. Repeat.  This is...
Shouldn't we call in?
You kids stay inside.  I mean it!  We'll be right back.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Awright, let's go girls, they ain't payin' us by the hour.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound off!  Wierzbowski?
First squad, assemble on me at the main lock.
Flame thrower!  Move!
Go to infrared.  Looks sharp people!
I don't know.  Is there anything you can do?
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Let's move it, girls!  On the ready line.  Let's go, let's go.
Position?
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.
Second squad?  What's your status?
Tease us a bit.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Tench-hut!
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck the heat exchanger!
You know it ain't up to me.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying 
ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
I checked.  The hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting.
I gave him a shot, for the pain. We'll need to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical.
I had to circle and hope things didn't get too rough to take you off.
I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.  Is there a problem?
I'll be in medical.  I'd like to continue my analysis.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?
I'm sorry if I gave you a scare but that platform was just becoming too unstable...
I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
Mr. Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.  He was very specific.
Not bad for a human.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Ripley...
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization.
An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
This duct runs almost to the up-link assembly.  One hundred eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes to crawl down there.
One hour to patch in and align the antenna. Thirty minutes to prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time.
Well, thanks, I --
Well, that explains it.  The A/2's were always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors.
Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.
It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Yes.  That follows.
A synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out.  Some deaths were involved.
All right.  My instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...Fifty-seven years.
Are these the same...?
Corporal Hicks!?
Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.
Hear me out...
Here we go.
Hi, Ripley.  This is Lieutenant Gorman of the...
Hmm.  Acid for blood.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
I know, I know, but we're dealing with changing scenarios here.  This thing is major, Ripley.  I mean really major.  You gotta go with its energy.
Since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious, serious money.
If you go.
It was a bad call, that's all.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Look, this is a multimillion dollar operation.  He can't make that kind of decision.  He's just a grunt!
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Looks like my room in college.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Now, wait a second --
Ripley we have to talk.
Ripley...help me.  I can feel it...inside.  Oh, God...it's moving!  Oh gooood...
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Sorry...I've been running behind all morning.
Still nothing from the colony?
That's the plan.  My word on it.
These are dead.  There's just the two alive.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Think about it.
This is absurd!  You don't have the authority to --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Not enough to have to wake up to your face, Drake.
Sir!
Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?
Hold her...Get me an airway, stat! And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!
Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look like I feel.
They ain't payin' us enough for this.
Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!
No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous life larger than a simple virus.
To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words...
Would you just listen to yourself for one minute.
Do you mind?
Attention.  Attention.  Automatic fueling operations have begun. Please extinguish all smoking materials.
Got it.  Rough air ahead.
Initiate release sequencer on my mark.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark!
She's supposed to be some kinda consultant... (exaggerated) ...She was an alien once.
Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.
Turning on final.  Coming around to a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal guidance locked in.  Where's the damn beacon?
Sir, you should check this out...
Clear, please.
Hey, hand job, you take my towel?
Hotter'n hell in here.
FROST No, Sir.  Looks like it was a helluva fight.
FROST Right ahead here...
Alive?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.
All right.  I want this to go smooth and by the numbers.  I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830.
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Come on, we're wasting our time.
Dead on all channels.
I said...
Let's saddle up.
Let's see.  Everybody on line. Drake, check you camera.  There seems to be a...
No bodies?
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.  Just start at the beginning...
Okay, stand by in operations.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Quarter and search by twos.  Second team move inside.  Hicks, take the upper level.  Use your motion trackers.
Ripley, what the hell...?
Shit.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
So.
They ripped apart the colony for building materials.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Total brain-lock.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
We can't see anything back here, Apone.  What's going on?
Well...two.  Three, including this one.
What is it?
What's the question?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
You can't use those in here!
You still want to kill me?
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
About seventeen days.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
All right, stand by there.  We're on out way.  Over.
Are you finished?
B gun's dry.  Twenty on A. Ten.  Five.  That's it.
Behind us.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.
Fuckin' A!
Get on the Goddamn door!
Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing on multiple targets.
Here, put this on.  Then I can locate you anywhere in the complex on this --
He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.
He's gone!  Forget it, he's gone!
Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right now.
How long since you slept? Twenty-four hours?
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
It's moving.
It's okay...we're clear.  We're clear.  Ease up.
Just a...precaution.  You know.
Just let it drop right out.  Get the other one in quick.  Just slap it in hard, it likes abuse. Now, pull the bolt.
Just pull it in real right.  It will kick some.  When the counter here heads zero, hit this...
Let's get these things lit.
Looks like a Goddamn town meeting.
Looks that way.
M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and under with a 30mm pump-action grenade launcher.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Nothing.  No movement.
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.
Poor bastard.
Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna need an immediate evac.
Save it.
Sounds like a blown transaxle. You're just grinding metal.
Stand back.
The corner!  Ready?
They're coming.  They're in the tunnel.
This is all we could salvage.  We've got four pulse-rifles with about fifty rounds each.  Not so good. About fifteen M-40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full...one damaged.  And We've 
got four of these robot-sentry units with scanners and display intact.
This way.  We're close...
Twenty meters and closing. Fifteen.  C and D guns down about fifty percent.
Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in medical!  We got a fire!
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
We didn't miss anything.
We got problems.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Well you're not reading it right!
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Well, they're into the complex.
Yeah.  But look...
Yeah.  I've noticed.
You just got three weeks.
You're ready again.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Aye-firmative.
Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.
Can't lock up...
Do it!
Excuse me.
Fifteen meters.
Fuuuck!  He's dead.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Hey, if you like that, you're gonna love this...
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Hudson here.  A and B sentries are in place and keyed.  We're sealing the tunnel.
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
I am ready, man.  Ready to get it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the ultimate badass...state of the badass art.  You do not want to fuck with me.
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.  Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you. Check-it-out...
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
If they're within twenty klicks we'll read it out here, but so far...zip.
Independently targetting particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP! Fry half a city with this puppy. We got tactical smart-missles, phased-plasma pulse-rifles, RPG's.
We got sonic eeelectronic ballbreakers, we got nukes, we got knives...sharp sticks --
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
It's inside the complex.
It's readin' right.  Look!
Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe it.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Man, listen to that.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Movement!
Movement!  Signal's clean.
Multiple signals.  All round. Closing.
Nine meters.  Eight.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Nothing.  Zip.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Range twenty meters.
Seventeen meters.
Sir?
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Sure, Hicks.
There's something.
They must be like Gorman.  Their signs are real low but they ain't dead!
They must be wall to wall in there.  Look  at those ammo counters go.  It's a shooting gallery down there.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
This floor's freezing.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Uh, what's next?
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Well, that's a switch.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
What're we supposed to use, man?  Harsh language?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Would you, Sir?
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Yeah...but it's a dry heat.
Folks, we have scored big this time.
I got too many partners.
Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.
When we get rich, Newt.
So what do I tell this guy?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke. I work for the company, but other than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to see you're feeling better.  I'm told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon.  
Side effects of the unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Why don't I open the viewport? Watch your eyes.
And half mine!
And hope to die?
Are we going to sleep now?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Can we dream?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Come on!  This way.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Daddy, when are we going back to town?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Did you ever have a baby?
Do not.  I'm just the best.
Don't go!  Please.
Go right.
Here!  Go up.
Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
I don't want you for a friend.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Just up there --
Look!
Mom.  All the kids play it...
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Mommy...mommmyyyyy...
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
N-newt.
Riiiiipppleee --
Ripley, I was just thinking... Maybe I could do you a favor and fill in for her.  Just for a while.  You can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. I'll understand.  No big deal. Whattya think?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
So!  That's why I'm the best.
Sure.  Go left.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Timmy...they've been gone a long time.
Wah...?  Where are...?
We should get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon.  They come mostly at night.  Mostly.
Where is she?
Why do they tell little kids that?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
You always say that.  I wanna go back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
You mean dead.
You promise?
All right.  I'm in.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Amy.
And it's too late to shut it down?
And the colonists...When they were done with them.
And you my dear, are staying right here.
Back.  Go back!
Bad call?  These people are fucking dead, Burke!  Well, they're going to nail your hide to the shed... and I'll be there when they do.
BISHOP!
Bullshit!
Burke!
Burke!  Open the door!
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Christ, Wierzbowski!
Climb down, honey.  We have to cut through this grate.
Come on, you can make it. Almost there.
Could it be intelligent?
Cross my heart.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Do you people have earwax, of what?  We have been here three hours.  How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?
Ellen.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Fine.  You do that.
Forget it.
Get away from her, you bitch!
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
Hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this. And a pretty one at that.
Have they located my daughter yet?
He wanted an alien, only he couldn't get it back through quarantine.  But if we were impregnated ...whatever you call it...and then frozen for the trip back at just the right time...then nobody would 
know about the embryos we were carrying. We and Newt.
Here!
Here, try this.  A little instant hot chocolate.
Here.
Here.  Take is for luck.  Now go to sleep...and don't dream.
Hicks!  Hicks!
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
How do you feel?
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
How long have I been on Gateway station?
How long until it blows?
How long was I out there?  They won't tell me anything.
How long?
How many colonists?
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
HOW MUCH TIME?
Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?
I don't know how you managed to stay alive but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
I don't know.
I feel like a fifth wheel here.  Is there anything I can do?
I get the picture.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
I know, honey.  Me too.
I promised her I'd be home for her birthday.  Her eleventh birthday.  I sure missed that one.
I think it's not the worst idea I've heard all day.  Let's talk about it later.
I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship.  We homed on its beacon...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
If I go.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
I'll bet Casey doesn't have bad dreams.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Is she...?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's over.
It's okay, it's okay.  It's over... you're going to be all right now... it's okay...you're safe...
I've dictated what I know on these.
Jones!
Just find someplace to lock him up until it's time to --
Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that straight?
Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I 
suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Look, I told you...
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Looks like it stung him.
Medical!  Get to medical!
Newt!
Newt!  Newt!
Newt!  Stay close.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Newt, wait!
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Newt?  Where's Newt?
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
No!  Noooo!
No, it's different, honey.
No.  There's no way!
No...noooo!
Nothing bad in here.  Maybe you could just try to be like her.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Now many?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad went away like that, didn't they?
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Okay.  It's important to understand this organism's life cycle.  It's actually two creatures.  The first form hatches from a spore...a sort of large egg, and attaches itself to its victim.  Then it 
injects an embryo, detaches and dies. It's essentially a walking sex organ. The --
One of us?
Pleased to meet you.  And who is this?  Does she have a name?
Punch it, Bishop!
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Run!
See you, Hicks.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
So you better just start dealing with it.  Just deal with it, Hudson...because we need you and I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file. 
Construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that shows the layout of this place.  I want to see air ducts, electrical access tunnels, subbasements.  Every possible way into this wing.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Stay behind me.
That the atmosphere processor?
That's not all, Goddamnit!  If those things get back here, that will be all.  Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss it goodbye.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
That's right.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder.  Who had access to it?
There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all right.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
They cut the power.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
They retreated.  The guns stopped them.
They're at the fire door.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Uh oh.  I made a clean spot here.  Now I've done it.  Guess I'll just have to do the whole thing.
Wait!  Tell him to...
Watch it, Burke...
We made it, Jones.  We made it.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Well, Newt it is then.  My name's Ripley...and people call me Ripley.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
We're going home, honey.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
What about me?
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
What are you talking about. What people?
What did you say?
What do I do?
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
What?
What's this?
Where you want it?
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Why not?
Why not?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Yes.  A little girl.
Yes?
You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can.  I never can.
You bet.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
You did okay, Bishop.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
You okay?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
You son of a bitch.
You're really something, ace.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get 
an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Yeah.  What?
Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for this shit.
I mean breathing, not this frozen shit.
Need anything else?
Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists. What's this crap supposed to be?
Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile. Picking up some hull ionization.
Yeah...previews.
Cheater!
Do too!  You go in places we can't fit.
You cheat too much.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
It is the finding of this board of inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley, NOC-14672. has acted with questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an ICC license as a commercial flight officer.
Look at it from our perspective. You freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-Class star-freighter.  A rather expensive piece of hardware...
Said license is hereby suspended indefinitely.
No criminal charges will be filed at this time and you are released on own recognizance for a six month period of psychometric probation, to include monthly review by an ICC psychiatric tech...
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Terraformers...planet engineers. It's what we call a shake 'n' bake colony.  They set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable...big job.  Takes decades.
They've already been there over twenty years.  Peacefully.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Thank you, that will be all.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
The shuttle's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account.
That the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time.  That repairs were made.  That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct.  By you.
For reasons unknown.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Drake!  He's down!
Fuck you.
He's fucking dead!
How many combat drops?
Hudson, give us a break.
I only need to know one thing.
Let's rock.
Listen.  It's stopped.
No.  Have you?
Right.  Fire in the hole!
Where they are.
Which way?
Who's the fresh meat again?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
You fuck!
You staying in here?
Attention.  Emergency.  All personnel must evacuate immediately.  You now have fourteen minutes to reach minimum safe distance.
You now have eleven minutes to reach minimum safe distance.
You now have thirty seconds to reach...
You now have two minutes to reach minimum safe distance.
A what?
Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't mind getting me some more a that Arcturan poontang.  Remember that time?
Is he fucking crazy?
Last stand.
Scare you?
She don't like the cornbread either.
Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an eye on you.
Please...God...kill me.

I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
Sexual relations means intercourse, plain and simple.
The prosecution coined that definition, not me.
In Mississippi a man can legally marry a 13 year old?  That's why it's called _Miss_issippi.
The whole truth means just that.
That depends on what the definition of the word _is_ is.

I've known amoeba which have made more sense than you, my friend.
Let me tell you a secret.  I have absolutely no idea what you're blathering on about!

I hope you have some evidence to back you up on that.
Tell me something I don't know!
I wish I could believe you, I really do!
I've known that for a long time.
That's a fairly outrageous claim.
That's just a tad unbelievable.
Yeah, everyone knows that!
I wish I could tell you, but I must desist!
I hate avoiding questions, but I'm going to avoid that one!
Perhaps you could tell me?  On second thoughts, don't bother.
What is it with these silly questions?  Anyway, let's talk about something else...
What the hell are you talking about?
What am I to you?  Some sort of encyclopaedia or something?  Let's change the subject...
Does it really matter?  Anyhow, let's chat about something interesting!
How boring!  Everybody and his dog asks me that!
You are soooo predictable it's not funny!
That is a universal mystery, methinks.
Please don't trouble me with such droll.
You are an bottomless pit of questions.
Let's talk about something vaguely interesting.
I guess that line of conversation is buggered, then!
If you want to keep your private life private, I understand.
Awww geez, I'm running out of things to talk about!
Well, this is certainly dragging on, isn't it?

My moogle makes more sense than you!
So, who is using the family brain cell at the moment?
Did you really think you could leave your brain at the door.
I've seen elderly chocobos with better typing skills than you!
You're a loony.
Are you inventing new words or something?
I find your spelling of certain words rather interesting.
Whoah!  Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning?
I'm thanking my lucky stars that I haven't had the misfortune to meet you in person yet.
Hmmm... it seems I've over-estimated your intellect...
Perhaps you should just try to make some sense!
I find that interesting, intellectually stimulating, and thoroughly confusing.
No man has ever spoken a more profound truth.
What a load of codswallop!
I think you may have lost the plot.
Honestly, what a pile of fetid chocobo kidneys!
If I were to judge your IQ by what you're typing, I would arrive at a pathetically small number.
Stop your dull little tricks, please!
You really are the least interesting person I've talked to today.
I haven't understood half of what you've said in this conversation.
I've been more entertained talking with Barret.
Your wordplay is pathetic.
Obviously you'll never be accused of having a shining wit!
Are you just saying things at random now?
I think I've worked it out!  You are the computer program, and I am the smartest cat alive!

Hahaha!  That's a good one!
Hohoho!  Awwww, you're gorgeous!
Hehehe!  Quite funny that, isn't it?
Tee hee!  That's thoroughly amusing.

Ha ha ha!  It is to laugh.
He he he.  Just who is he?
Bwahahahaha! You slay me, you know that?

You are a stupid bloody moron with no right to exist as a sentient being.
Not only are you an idiot, but you are a dumb one too!
You are the biggest dunderhead of all the people I've had the misfortune to talk to.
You are a silly billy who shouldn't be here at all.
You are the most stupid person I've met all day.
You are so much of an idiot it's not funny.

#	Script
#

the governorship.... You forced me to come here and set things straight... personally.
"God created Arrakis to train the faithful." One cannot go against the word of God. 
"He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing". 
"Your gift is a blessing of the river." 
...beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis. 
...His wife was Bene Gesserit too... the signs are al over him.... They must have killed here. 
...Many men have tried. 
...Why? 
...and a traitor... God help us. 
...and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous. 
...beyond her years and of things no child could know -- things of the past.
...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond...to have superior powers... Our power to fold space is in the spice...
Without us, your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets... You would be lost. 
...Gurney! We desperately need more spice miners... many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle. We need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men ... any with open sand experience.
You must persuade them to enlist with us. 
...my love. 
...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow... 
...they don't like Alia around. She frightens them. It is the strangeness of your daughter. 
A chance for escape? But for whom? 
A daughter who knew at birth everything I know... 
A Fremen... Could she be the operator? No... 
A knife....
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh... 
A sandrider!... 
A storm is coming -- our storm... and when it comes it will shake the Universe. Emperor... we come for you. 
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes! 
A thumper. 
A traitor... 
A treasure. 
A... little... closer.... The... water... of my life... for Paul. 
Achiii! -- 
Activate a fighter. 
Activate your weirding modules...
Alia keeps pace with the storm. -- 
Alia! 
ALIA! 
Alia! What is it? -- 
Alia. 
All I can see is an Atreides that I want to kill. 
Always. 
Always? 
And how can this be? 
And now the prophecy... 
And the means of my death should I prove otherwise. 
And when we've crushed these people enough I'll send in you Feyd... they'll cheer you as a rescuer... lovely Feyd... really a lovely boy. 
And your son will pay with you. 
Are you a Fremen? 
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal? 
Are you trained in the ways of the desert? 
Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet... moving... moving. 
Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet. 
Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet. 
Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet... moving... moving. 
As I said... they defend the spice sands. As to their relationship with the spice... who knows. 
As the legend says. 
As you instructed me, I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t... -- 
Atomics! 
Basically... 
Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my father's armies were never able to fully develop this new form. This is what I will teach you.
You will be the fiercest and most feared fighters in the Universe. 
Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work. 
Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans. 
Bi-la kaifa. 
Bi-la kaifa. 
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him. May his passage cleanse the world. 
Break! 
Bring in that floating fat man... the Baron. 
Bring in the messenger. 
Bring these satchels! 
But he was said to... 
But Your Reverence, they won't have her around them. 
Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign! 
Calm yourself/ 
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... --
Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him all honor. 
Change it that we may all drink of it. -- 
Chani.... I love you... I've always loved you.... --
Chuksa! 
Chuuk-sa... 
Chuuuk-sa... 
Cinnamon... the spice! 
Clear and lock the room. 
Come here. 
Come on boys... come on. 
Come with me. 
Come with me. I'll show you an easier way down. 
Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control? 
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib? 
Damn it... Harkonnens. 
Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy. 
Damn the spice! Get out of there. 
Death may be the result.... Are you sure? 
Did they try and fail? 
Did they try and fail? 
Did you hear a noise from the little one? -- 
Did you really think that you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you! 
Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker? 
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT... 
Do not speak!... Listen!... You do not have more than this one chance.... I represent the entire Guild in this matter.... You have failed to kill the Atreides heir... Paul. 
Do you know its meaning? 
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug? 
Do you know the Water of Life?... Come... ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries... the end and the beginning. 
Do you know this my lady? 
Do you need my life, old friend? 
Do you smell it? 
Don't mention the Duke... This is an uncoded channel. 
Don't touch my mother... 
Don't try your powers on me. Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!!
You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required. Here I stand. But... I will never be yours. 
Don't you trust your own eyes. 
Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis? --
Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him. 
Drink! 
Drum sand! 
Duke Leto Atreides. Someone's torn the insignia off your uniform. Such carelessness. 
Duke Leto Atreides.... 
Duncan! 
Duncan! What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me. Why haven't we heard from you? 
Duncan!! Duncan!! 
Dust cloud ahead, Sire. 
Each day the palms along the outer wall of the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one hundred men.
The palms were placed by the Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in front of the city Fremen. 
Eight.... Thufir Hawat... Mentat... Master of Assassins. 
Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad.... SEND THEM BACK! 
Emperor Shaddam IV... You have one last chance to take matters into your own hands and bring the situation under the control on Arrakis. 
Excellent! 
Falsify the reports. We can't hide it all, tell them we've lost only two hundred harvesters... and forty carryalls... and don't let my uncle know about the destruction of the spice silos....
I will catch this Muad'dib and suck the blood from him!! SUCK THE BLOOD FROM HIM!!! --
Far off in the control rooms.... Travelling without moving. 
Faster!! -- 
Father! 
Father!... Father! THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED. 
Father!... father... drugged... --
Father. 
Father.
Father... now I have become a killer and I will continue to kill until I have avenged your death. 
Father... our time has come. 
Feyd, even though he's aging, Thufir is one of the finest Mentats in the Universe... and he's mine, Feyd... all mine.... Quiet now. 
Feyd, no, no! Thufir's a Harkonnen now, aren't you Thufir? 
Fifty legions?... 
First cut my son's bonds. 
Flesh dropping off. 
For Paul... 
For... he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him. 
Forgive me... 
From my dream... so beautiful. Liet.... is this Kynes' daughter? 
Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire, we can't leave this spice... 
Get out of my mind!!! 
Get that shield up!
Give me spice! Drive them into utter submission. You must not show the slightest pity or mercy... as only you can... Never stop! 
Go now! Take him to his desert to die. Go! 
Go.... Show no mercy! 
Gods, what a monster. 
Good. You have some idea of what I would do but I will tell it to one who has never been seen... one who hides deep in the Heighliner control rooms. He will hear it first. 
Good... Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides... I want to see you in your mother's chamber in one quarter of an hour. 
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down. 
Goodbye, Jessica and goodbye to your sweet son.... I want to spit once on your head... just some spittle on your face -- what a luxury. 
Great Mother! This changes both! What have we done? --
Greater than treasure, Usul. We have thousands of such caches. Only a few of us know them all. When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!... 
Guard yourself for true! 
Guard. Open the door. 
Gurney!... 
Gurney, now! 
Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the atomics. I want an opening through the entire Shield Wall. Stilgar? Do we have wormsign? 
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives. Let him stand free. 
Harah! Would they deny me the right to use this mind?... -- 
Harkonnen... 
Harkonnens. 
Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix. Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very precise estimate. Who is on that unlisted flight? 
Have you noticed the line of palms along the wall... the Harkonnen put them in... to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people....
Each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men. 
He is here, my lord. 
He knows. 
He shall know your ways as if born to them. 
He shouldn't speak of this... 
He was in the Palace with the Atreides... I also say he was a spy for the Emperor. 
He will come...the voice from the outer world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad, which will cleanse the Universe and bring us out of darkness. He will have been born of a Bene Gesserit mother. 
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can. 
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you. 
Here he is... We've got to go. 
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. 
Here it comes... 
Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond... 
He's been repeating that name ever since we found him. 
He's coming round, my Lord. 
He's crying! He's crying, Piter. What does he mean? 
He's crying! 
He's hiding something -- holding something back. 
He's hiding something. 
He's sabotaged the house generators, we're wide open. 
Hit it... 
House Atreides is ruined. 
How dare you speak to me... 
How many men do you have? 
Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm. 
Hurry! 
Hurry! All I see is darkness. 
I know she has come to test him... no man has ever been tested with the box... only Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son. 
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change. 
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.... I would not have permitted you to harm my tribe. 
I am only a seed. 
I am only a seed... 
I am so much more... You don't begin to know me... 
I am the messenger from Muad'dib. Poor Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you. 
I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper, Noble Born. What are your orders. 
I am the Shadout Mapes... the housekeeper. 
I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib. 
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...
I can assure you... 
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock. Maybe that small rock. 
I can't see him yet but he's very close... 
I can't... I can't. 
I could use The Voice... make him tell me... It would only shame him. 
I didn't hear anything. 
I have heard of it. -- 
I have her, Majesty! 
I have NO FEELINGS!! Why? 
I have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen... only 125 meters long. 
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall. 
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals. 
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born." 
I know it. 
I know many things. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice. -- 
I know 
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages. 
I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin. 
I know the secret. The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm. 
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back to the door. 
I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going? 
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed. 
I mean this, Thufir. If you are to strike, do it now. 
I must cleanse the way between us.... You saved my life... and we Fremen pay our debts. It's known to us that you've a traitor in your midst. Who it is we cannot say but we're certain of it. 
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child? 
I must not fear. Fear is the mind- killer... the little death that brings total obliteration... 
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. --
I must place more trust in my friends. 
I must speak with you Leto! 
I must speak with you Leto! --
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born. 
I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine. I can kill with a word. -- 
I see the truth of it. -- 
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it. 
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice. 
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished. 
I sit on the throne!! -- 
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor. 
I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll pay for my own mistakes. 
I want fifty legions of Sardaukar on Arrakis at once. 
I want you to be proud of me. 
I was on my way to say goodbye to you. I have to go on ahead. 
I will have Arrakis back for myself... he who controls the Spice, controls the universe... and what Piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto.
This person... this traitor... will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar. 
I will take one hundred of your warriors and train them. This one hundred will train the thousands that remain. When the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to Arrakis.
The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us. Arrakis will become the center of the Universe. 
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- 
I will try to pass within. 
I will. 
I wish it. 
I wish to kill a man... not you, my dear Duke, but the Baron.... You were dead already... but you will be close to the Baron before you die. You will be tied and drugged but you can still attack.
When you see the Baron you will have a new poison tooth. He will want you close so he can gloat over you. One bite on this tooth and a strong exile... 
I won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack. However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom. -- 
I'd know the difference. 
I'd like to have some fun before we kill her. 
I'd thought of many pleasures with you. It is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm. Desire clouds my reason.... That is not good... that is bad. 
If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my blade in his hand. 
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one. 
I'll miss the sea... but a person needs new experiences... they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow.
Without change, something sleeps inside us... and seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken. 
I'll see you in Arrakis. May the hand of God be with you. 
I'm a seed. 
I'm alive!!! I'm alive!!! 
I'm ready. 
I'm sorry Gurney. 
I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it. 
Impossible! 
In payment of the many years of service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish. Anything at all. 
Irulan. 
Is he....? 
Is there a problem?... Usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit. 
Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice? 
Is this what you seek? 
It burns. 
It can render flesh to dust in minutes. And these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere.
Our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on Arrakis. 
It could only be one thing.... 
It does look dry.... 
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed - The lips acquire stains - The stains become a warning - It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. 
It is changed! 
It is the legend. 
It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women.
It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried... 
It is yours. 
It meant so much to him... 
It was Feyd! Where is the ducal signet ring? I must have his ring. 
It was Feyd. 
It was Feyd? 
It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us. --
It's a crysknife. 
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated.
Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck.
Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads.
Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes. 
It's a maker... 
It's all right Gurney. 
It's deafening! 
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come.... I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- 
It's not just his wife... He's a good man though. He's probably trying to save my feelings... 
It's Paul. He's taken the Water of Life. 
It's something for your father. He wants to talk to you. 
It's the way she speaks of things... 
I've been a long time waiting for you. Here is my life. 
I've brought House Atreides down. I've destroyed the new army's weirding modules. 
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't! 
I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things. 
Jessica! 
Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace. 
Jessica... You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides... Jessica! 
Keep going... 
Kill this child!! She's an abomination!! Kill her. 
know... you must conquer the beast of the desert, both his outer and his deadly inner powers. 
Korba... 
Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father... nothing? 
Leave us. 
Let him stand free! 
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die.
You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat. 
Leto! He's dead! He's dead... -- 
Leto! Leto! 
Leto... where are you? 
Liet! 
Liet? 
Listen here.... You can here the people of Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers? 
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years...
the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life. 
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- 
LONG LIVE DUKE LETO! 
Long live Duke Leto! 
Long live the fighters! 
Long live the fighters! 
Long live the fighters! 
Majesty, into the ship! 
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... 
Man-carved steps. 
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily. 
Many machines on Ix... new machines. 
Mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded. 
May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan. 
Moisture... 
Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With your permission, I will check the security of your suits. 
Mother - help me! 
MOTHER! Tell me! 
Mother. 
Motion... Chuuk-sa... 
Move back! 
Muad'dib! 
Muad'dib! 
Muad'dib!... 
Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!... Muad'dib! 
My brother is coming... with many Fremen warriors. 
My dear Duke... how I have failed you. --
My father sent you to test me. Music then? 
My greatest student... and my greatest disappointment.... He's awake!... He's listening to us. 
My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one. 
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock. 
My lady... the local people... the maids and servants await your inspection. Hawat has cleared them. 
My Lord! 
My lord... I suspect so much. I think they are the allies we seek... they are strong and fierce... they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly....
As you know, the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen. Everyone thinks that there are but few -- wandering here and there in the desert....
My lord, I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet... that the Fremen exist in vast numbers... vast numbers... and it is they that control Arrakis. 
My Lord? 
My own name is a killing word. Will it be a healing word as well? 
My plan! 
My son. 
My thanks. 
My wife... you didn't know my wife... they... -- 
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice. 
No one ever dreamed there would be so many. 
No one. It... seemed the proper way. 
No! 
No! This is the place where we cannot look. The place only for the eyes of the Kwisatz Haderach. 
No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will save the lives of your Paul and Jessica. 
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it! 
No, but many consider my training valuable. 
No. 
No. 
No. 
No? 
Noooooo... he is not dead. He is not eaten by worms as you have wanted to believe. He is not missing. He is in the deep desert with the Fremen. The Spice is in great danger.
We are not asking... we are telling... remedy the situation or you will live out your life in a pain amplifier. 
Not all of them... I know which ones will. 
Not impossible. I told you... He is here now. 
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting. 
Not sorry enough. 
Not until you tell them both who I really am. 
Nothing. 
Now my daughter and I are both Reverend Mothers. 
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence. 
Now we will see which way the decision tips. 
Now you come here. 
Now! 
Now! -- 
Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne. 
Now... the test of the water of life... what is it that waits for me in this darkness? 
Now? 
Of course... what did you think? 
Oh great mother! He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him. 
Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your heart plug already.... Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here. But this is not why we're here.
We've brought you a little cat, Thufir. You must care for it if you wish to live. A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.
By milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote... it must be done each day.... Also, you must do something for me if you wish to live.
You know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat... 
Oh yes? -- 
Oh, my God! 
One among us has consented to enter the rite. She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother. 
One carryall handles four spice mining teams; however, it will fly only two harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty-one carryalls.... 
Only the very strong ones travel this deep.... 
Only?! 
Orato! 
Ordered by whom? -- 
Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once again in control of Arrakis. Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to crush the Harkonnens. We must do more than this.
We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis. The Guild and the entire universe depends on spice. 
Our way of battle is built on rhythm. You understand rhythm like this but you do not yet understand the rhythm of the higher sounds, sounds that heal and build... sounds that destroy.
Motion is the base. You understand the motion... but you do not yet understand the motion that heals and builds... motions that destroy... 
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation. 
Pain. 
Paul! 
Paul! 
Paul! 
Paul!! Paul!! 
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you... 
Paul. 
Paul... I will love you forever... in life or in death... let Shai-Hulud judge now. 
Paul... Paul. 240B. EXT. WAVE CRASHING
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you. 
Paul?... This is very important... 
Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?! 
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of. 
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. 
Piter. 
Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders... 
Please... -- 
Precise control.... 
Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round real neat. 
Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides blood! We've gutted them. We've gutted them! 
Rabban, Rabban... I place you in charge of Arrakis. It's yours to squeeze, as I promised. I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze. 
Refuse... 
Release the Sardaukar. Baron... give this little abomination to the storm. 
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper. 
Remove her gag! 
Reverend Mother... I will give you the Tleilaxu Path. 
Run! 
Say it not lightly...
Sayyadina. Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest. She asks that you pass within. 
seven by seven a seven the seven call seven B seven -- enter the circles call the sixth copy the sixth over the summit.... eight. 
See this... Put your right hand in the box. 
Seitch Tabr. 
Set the range for two meters. 
Set up a sonar probe immediately! 
Seventeen Great Houses of the Lansraad have reported a significant delay in delivery of spice per CHOAM agreement. This constitutes a serious violation of CHOAM codes.
Contact Baron Vladimir Harkonnen immediately. 
Shai-Hulud... Shai-Hulud. 
She did it! 
She lives? 
She's using The Voice. 
Shhhhh. 
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood. 
SILENCE! 
Silence!... I do not court your brother's pleasure. 
SILENCE... SILENCE. 
Sire! 
Sister of Paul Muad'dib. 
Sleep well... my son. 
So many reminders of the scarcity of water. 
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides... 
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist? 
So you are the ones. 
So, this is Leto the Just... 
Some strength there. Surprising! 
Someone is going to pay for this... I promise. 
Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone. 
Soon they'll begin to fold space. 
Sound... as a weapon. If only you could see them, father. 
Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting. 
Speak to us... from the outer world. 
Spice!... pure un-refined spice! 
Spice... 
Spotter control -- give me a report by the numbers. 
Spotter control... no sign of the carryall... it isn't answering. 
Stand-by... warning... we have just received a coded threat from the Guild. Spice production is in serious jeopardy... Giedi Prime supplying false reports...
Guild to visit Emperor in one standard day. 
Stilgar... 
Stop him yourself. 
Stop him, Jessica! 
Stop your speaking!! 
Stop! Get back!! She has the weirding way. Why didn't you tell us! Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.
As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary. Your water shall mingle with our water. 
STOP! Put your hand in the box. 
Take him away. 
Take the water of my life! 
Take them to the desert, as the traitor suggested and worms will destroy the evidence. Their bodies must never be found. --
Tell me of your homeworld, Usul. 
Tell me of your homeworld, Usul. 
Terrible purpose.... What is it? 
Thank you for joining me, Paul. 
That it is. 
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. 
That's it. 
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves.
Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice. 
That's our entire reserves as well. 
The answer is within the problem... 
The antidote... 
The arm... 
The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me....
I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens....
House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain.
Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides...
I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops. 
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto. 
The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives have already been taken. We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all know what to do. 
The Bene Gesserit witch must leave. --
The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen? 
The calming exercise. 
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- 
The dream unfolds. 
The drug was timed. Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us.... What a pity you must remain gagged. We can't let ourselves be swayed by your witch's Voice, now, can we? 
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- 
The Emperor's blade. 
The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways? 
The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib. They will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe... they will have Arrakis... Dune... their planet.
There will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases. For the spice there will always be some desert. There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen have a saying... 
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- 
The Harkonnens may have tampered medically.... please wait. 
The legend. 
The little one! 
The Mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing. 
The most lethal poison in the Universe. 
THE PAIN! 
The Palace is now secure. The city of Arrakeen is under martial law... we have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors six through ten.
The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and we have some on the airfield. Our new army is still training, but everything is shielded.... With the shielding, we are impenetrable.
Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire, for your inspection of spice mining operations, but since the attempt of the young master, I am against your leaving the Palace. 
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot. 
The plan to crush the Atreides. Feyd, Rabban... go quietly... no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron.
The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor. 
The Princess shall have no more of me than my name... no child of mine or touch the softness of glance... nor instant of desire.... This is my promise to you... 
The righteous! 
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron. I... 
The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets. 
The second moon, your moon... 
The second moon... from the dreams... 
The seed must grow. 
The shield is down! The shield is down! 
The Shield Wall is gone. 
The shield! 
The shield! The shield! 
The sleeper must awaken. 
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock... 
The spice! It's in everything here. The air, the soil, the food... It's like the Truthsayer drug..... It's a poison!!!!
You knew the spice would change me. But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness. I can see it... I can see it. 
The storms and the worms. Is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour? 
The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic. I must transform the poison configuration within my body... the blue must be made clean. 
The Voice again. 
The Water of Life. 
The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them. 
The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret. With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it. -- 
The worm is eight minutes away, Sire. 
The young master is a trained Mentat, an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe. 
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions.... 
Then I will teach you our way of battle.... you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit. 
There are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert -- far from where we'll be in Arakeen....
The desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden.... Why? 
There is a Harkonnen among you. Give the Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth. 
There is a traitor among us. 
There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen... the enemy. 
There's more here... yes! 
There's no need to fight over me. 
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord. 
They said you were dead. They said... 
They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup as the east wind. And they shall gather the captivity of the sand. 
They tried and died. 
They tried and died.... 
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. 
They'll work until the very last minute. 
They're even better on the battlefield than in the training rooms!! 
They're on this floor somewhere.... 
Things have been so serious here lately. 
Think on it Chani... We who carry the name of concubine... history will call us wives. 
This Duke is more concerned over his men than the spice! I must admit... against all better judgement... I like this Duke. 
This is a Harkonnen animal. Let me, please, my Lord. 
This is genocide... the deliberate and systematic destruction of all life on Arrakis. 
This is my son, Paul. 
This is part of the weirding way that we will teach you. Some thoughts have a certain sound... that being the equivalent to a form.
Through sound and motion you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs.... We will kill until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air. 
This moon holds my future. --
This moon holds my past. 
This obelisk is of your hardest stone. Kick it... 
Those sounds could be imitated. 
Three... generations... of you... 
Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations.... He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same.... It makes me feel very proud... 
Thufir. Come. 
Thufir?... anything?... keep looking
To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines. 
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- 
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen. 
Two men in each of the spotters... You!... over here... run!! 
Two thumpers are planted. The worm may not surface for the first - he will rise for the second.
Remember, when the worm approaches, you must be utterly still... and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment....
The worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible and it will take you with it -- to the top.
Do not get too close as he approaches... the sand will engulf you.... Wait till the head of the worm passes -- then go... quickly. 
Unlisted flight northeast of you... wormsign on intercept course... estimated contact fifteen minutes. 
Usul has called a big one. Again... it is the legend. 
Usul no longer needs the weirding module. 
Usul... It is time you become a sandrider... and travel as a Fremen. Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and ride as a leader of men. 
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin. 
Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of which even God has never seen. 
Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive. We will not be prisoners here in this place. 
Wait... he must be near... 
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream. 
We are alone... 
We are coming down to take you off the harvester... All spotters are ordered to comply. 
We are the secret of the Universe. 
We are the secret of the Universe. We know of spice...the spice called melange...the greatest treasure in the Universe. It exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis, Dune.
We know of spice and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will awaken. 
We call that one Muad'dib. 
We don't know much about the Fremen... They live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes... 
We felt his presence. 
We found and removed another sabotage device. I think it will go up now. -- 
We found these sabotage devices too easily... 
We have just folded space from Ix... 
We have our new army. 
We have to get to that mountain of rock. We have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives... 
We ourselves... foresee a slight problem within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul Atreides. 
We sense that you may be the "voice from the outer world". Both moons told us of you. You must pass tests before we will 
We surprised a band of smugglers. 
We were ordered to kill them... so kill them. 
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood". 
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die! 
We'll salvage what we can... but I can tell you.. dear God... for the father... nothing. 
Well, how do the Fremen survive there? 
We're going to be heavy, Sire. 
We're wasting time, Sire. 
What about my Father? 
What are your orders, Piter? 
What can be done has been done. 
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon? 
What do you mean one last... 
What does Leto say, Piter? 
What does she fear? 
What happened? What happened to you? What is he saying? 
What happened? What? 
What happens now? 
What if she should fail? 
What is it? 
What is this?... Is this what kills the men who enter here? 
What will you call her? 
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly
What's happened?... Why did it leave? 
What's in the box? 
What's that you're saying? 
When the spice flow stops, the entire Universe will turn to Arrakis. The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us. 
When you see the Baron, remember the tooth! The tooth! 
Where are my feelings... I feel for no one... 
Where are the Harkonnens from here? 
Where are we do you think? 
Where are you.... Let me see you or there will be no spice. -- 
Where is your ring? 
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms. 
Where? 
Where's my doctor? 
Who calls Pad Nine? 
Who is the little one? A pet, perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions? 
Who is the traitor? 
Who is this Muad'dib? 
Who is this Paula Atreides to the Guild? And why? 
Why do they come? 
Why have you brought me here? 
Why isn't the shield up yet? 
Why prolong the inevitable? I will kill you! I will kill him! 
Why? I wish you were coming with us. 
Will we see a worm? 
Wind traps... huge ones. 
With a Fremen suit in good working order, one can sustain life for weeks, even in the deep desert. 
With your permission... 
Wormsign? Is it wormsign? -- 
Would they deny me the right to use this voice?... 
Would you really have drawn my blood? 
Yell at it... 
Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp eyes Sire.... May I? 
Yes, my lord Baron. 
Yes, my Lord. 
Yes, Sire. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real. 
Yes. Perhaps he would at that. 
Yes... 
Yes... 
Yes... yes, Sire! 
Yes? 
Yes? 
Yes?... How was your journey? 
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach... I'm something different, something unexpected! 
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch! Watch! 
You are my life. 
You are ours.... You are the one. 
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us.... We welcome you. 
You carry my unborn sister in your womb! 
You do not answer! 
You feel the flesh crisping? 
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar. This is your secret name in our troop.
But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly. 
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool! 
You know the ancient tongues? 
You know what I'm about to say is true.... I have the power to destroy the spice forever. 
You know when people speak the truth? 
You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto -- mother of the heir designate.... "Shadout"... that's an ancient word. 
You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides... his father. --
You must share with us. -- 
You mustn't speak of... 
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning. In time you perverted the truth. You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.
How little you understand. 
You see... your death... my blade will finish you. 
You should have told us. 
You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?... Desires don't figure in this! An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach.
We may lose both blood lines now. 
You were calling my name... it frightened me. --
You will make a formidable Duke! 
You will sit on a throne on Selusa Secundus, your prison planet. Either that or you will die. 
You wish now to join your wife, is that it, traitor? 
You wish to join her... join her, then. 
You young pup! You young pup! --
Your Highness... There must be some mistake... I never requested your presence.

Well, Steve, you and your listeners are probably not going to believe this but...
And Cameron would worry that he'd owe taxes on it.
You're really letting him stay home? I can't believe this. If I was bleeding out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to school. It's so unfair.
Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.
I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped you.
We'll drive home backwards.
Ninth Month.
What's the matter?
You asshole!
No problem whatsoever.
I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right now. If you have trouble finding the door...
I don't have all day to bark at you so I'll make this short and sweet.
I seriously doubt it. When's he back?
I don't know the details. But my boss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids. He's very popular.
I used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it. It used to worry me. Then I met Cameron and I saw how his family functioned.
150% better, thank you.
Oh, Christ...
Should you call the doctor?
Do you know what a nuclear winter is?
(Yeah. He's getting me out of summer school.
...I'll call myself.
1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less than a hundred were made. It has a market value of $265,000.
My father spent three years restoring it. It is joy, it is his love, it is his passion.
It really touches me that so many people are rallying behind this guy. I guess there's hope for the human race afterall.
Yeah, life is a carousel. A great big crazy ball of pure living, breathing joy and delight.
Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just now.
Oh, my God! You're dying? Is it serious?
Stay down, man.
It was that kind of concern.
What a beautiful day!
About 60.
I'm gonna bust his buns.
Great!
Dead grandmother.
Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy.
Ferris? You're overshadowed me long enough. I'm gonna get you, buddy.
Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?
Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on.
I have a guest with me today...
My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty 
serious.
My name is Bueller.
My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail.
I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped.
But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point.
I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing". ... Nothing was wrong.
There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying.
He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep.
How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit?
My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house.
Shiit! Are you upset?
Who?
Yes. Can you hold? Thank you.
You know this. Anyway, it's always been a dream of mine to be on the radio.
I have what I consider to be an excellent broadcast voice. I practise it in the bathroom all the time.
I used to play records and do introductions to them. But I've never had the chance to sit behind a microphone and try it out for real.
This is a 50,000 watt outlet. I'm going out to several million people so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant groove right now.
Sorry. She's taken.
I'm out of school, Mrs. Froeling. In fact. I'm married. This is my wife...Madonna.
Are you gonna chuck your nachos?
Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.
I wonder if he has a name?
He's looking at me and he's licking the glass and making obscene gestures with his hands.
TOM!
Today?
Kids!
Say, you must be very proud.
MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER, SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED...
WE HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER WE HOPE YOU'RE FELLING FIT WE...
WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT...
Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.
What's wrong? For Christ's sake! Look at him!
Pardon me.
Say, should you be in school?
How?
Why?
Of course, if they didn't, they'd be dumb and abnormal and they'd probably never move out of my house and I'd have to support them until I die. I take it back.
Here's where Cameron goes berserk.
If you had access to a car like this would you take it back right away? Would you give up feeling like a ton just to ease your best friend's tension?
She's not lying.
This is all news to me. She keeps a pretty good secret.
This kind of thing makes me a little depressed. You may think because I'm the age I am that I'm a sex maniac. That sex is all I think about. But that's not true. I'm a romantic.
I think alot of people my age are. We think about love and matters of the heart. And SAT scores and acne aside, we worry about lonliness. It's a terrible thing. And we feel it. I feel it.
And this is my brother-in-law, ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling.
Is Top a Slavic name?
It was pure selfishness. When I have a kid, I don't care how much I want something, if it's gonna screw-up the kid, forget it.
I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What is Rooney guesses my voice!
I'm showing houses to the family from California today but I'll be in the area. My office'll know where I am, if you need me.
May I help you?
You better get up in bed tight now.
You've seen them. Am I right?
Oh, I wanna puke.
That's right. Cart the stiff in and I'll turn over your daughter. It's school policy. Was this your mother?
Thank you for bringing him home, Mr. Rooney.
What's he doing?
You must be so excited.
If you keep this to yourself, I think we can probably get it on pretty good.
Thank you.
Well, Boyd, how are you bearing up?
Call the police. Go ahead. Better yet...
Did you see Alien? When the guy had the creature in his stomach? It feels like that.
Who's he talking to?
Shit. I hope he doesn't die. I can't handle summer school.
Hi, guys.
Is he serious?
Maybe I should call the office and tell them I won't be in.
Pardon moi.
Hello?
Thank you, Simone.
Dead grandmother.
He doesn't want me to.
I met Madonna.
It's Ferris Bueller. Nervy litttle punk. I'm gonna set a trap and let his walk right into it!
When you turn ten, your head's going to swell up real big like a watermelon and we're going to have to put you to sleep like they do with a dog.
Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.
Dad? Does my head look alright?
It's Ferris!
If it means anything to you, I have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING ITSELF OF OLD EGGS, GODDAMN IT!
Shut-up!
Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against putting any money into the house.
ALL OUR BEST FOR A SPEEDY RECOVERY THE ENGLISH DEPT. FACULTY AND STAFF
Commodity prices rose sharply today in unusually heavy trading...
Did you get in a fight?
Like it's a beautiful woman.
Since I was three.
You looking for something in my car?
Anyway, I appreciate you letting us know how you're doing. We gotta split.
Did you see Alien?
Did you see Alien?
Drugs.
Drugs?
Excuse you. You oughta spend a little more time dealing with yourself and a little less time worrying about what your brother does. It's just an opinion.
For sure.
Garth Volbeck.
Goddamn! Are you kidding?
I meant, are you here for drugs?
Oh. He's really wasted.
So, you're pissed at him because he ditches and doesn't get caught?
That's cool. Did you shoot him or something?
Then why don't you go home?
Then your problem is you.
There's somebody you should talk to.
What do you care if your brother ditches school?
What's your name?
Yeah, I'm serious.
You could ditch.
You know him?
You never rented the video cassette?
You want to talk about your problem?
How do you watch your mouth?
I don't think it's cute. I think it's fun.
I knew he was bullshitting.
Is he going up in the space shuttle in September?
Twice.
Here.
Here.
What?
Are you guys worried about nuclear war?
Do you think the car's alright?
Maybe.
Regardless. It's with us every day. The possiblity of global destruction.
Actually, what'll happen is I'll get caught. Ferris'll escape.
Are you crazy?! Put the top back up!
Because we can't! I want it back home where it belongs!
Call me sir, goddamn it!
Don't tell me we're not going to take the car home. Please.
Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.
Ferris, let's split, please?
Ferris, my father loves this car more than life itself. We can't take is out.
Ferris? It's not working.
Food...shelter...no...yes...
Forget it. I'm putting my foot down, Ferris. You'll have to think of something else...
Gesundheit...God...mercy...
Hannibal.
He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has it tatooed on his wrist.
He never drives it, Ferris. He just rubs it with a diaper.
He'll keep calling until I come over.
Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life.
Hi. No.
How does she do that? One goes one way, one goes the other.
Howcome it's my Dad's car and I'm taking all the risk and I have to ride back here?
Huh?
I asked you first.
I changed my mind, fella. You be out in front with her! I wanna have a few words with you!
I don't feel good, Ferris. Are we gonna stay long?
I don't have to wonder. I know.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I feel better now.
I feel like complete shit, Ferris. I can't go anywhere.
I got a better idea. It's cool.
I knew it was a mistake letting Ferris order for us.
I know you don't care.
I said for her to be there alone and you freaked!
I think I see my Dad.
I took a stand.
I want my daughter out in front of the school in ten minutes. By herself. I don's want anyone around...
I was a tractor tire.
I was home, sick. You get me out of bed, being me over here, make me jeopardize my future, make me do a phoney phone call on a dean of students, a man who could squeeze my nuts into oblivion and then 
you deliberately hurt my feelings.
I'd rather not have my family break apart, thank you.
If you get a blood test today.
If you guys only had one word, what would it be?
If your blood's not compatible, you could produce a pinhead. The state requires a blood test.
I'll give you two. My mother and father.
I'm dying.
I'm gonna handle it.
I'm not doing it.
I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't you leave me alone?
I'm with you, babe.
It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched, you name it.
It makes me puke. Seeing people treat each other like that. It's like the car. He loves the car. He hates his wife.
It's cool. I'm loose.
It's getting late, Ferris. I have to get the car home. I know you don't care, but it means my ass.
It's hard not to.
It's help.
It's human nature to like what you had better than what you have.
It's not a piece of shit.
It's okay.
It's the only word you could ever use.
I've been thinking all day that if you could only have the use of one word, what would it be?
Just because it happens doesn't make it right. Are you comfortable with it?
Let's go...Abe.
Money...tits...please...
Music...kiss...attack...
No, thanks. I want to deal with it by myself.
No.
No. The guy who rode the elephants into Switzerland.
Nothing.
Nothing. We return the car.
Oh, really?
One hundred and twenty six and halfway between three and four tenths. Why? How many miles are on it now?
Really?
Seventeen years and I've never taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna do it. I'm taking a stand against my father, against my family, against myself, against my past, my present and my future.
I will not sit idly by as events that affect me unfold to change the course of my life. I will take a stand and I will defend it.
When my father comes home tonight, he's finally going to have to deal with me. Good or bad, I'm taking a stand.
She's not home. Where are you?
Shit...
Shredded.
So, I in other words, I should just sit back and watch it crumble?
So, you can't get married today.
So, you're saying I should run away?
Stick it up your ass, Ferris.
Stop...water...want...
Surgery...fire...move...
Thank you, Sloane.
Thanks.
That makes no sense whatsoever.
That's a pretty grim thought.
That's better.
The miles aren't coming off, running it in reverse.
The whole time I was just thinking things over. I was like, meditating.
I was thinking about the future. And I realized it doesn't make and difference if the present goes to shit.
The word is help.
They may as well be.
They're married and they hate each other.
This isn't over yet, buster. You just make sure my daughter's out in front of the school in ten minutes. Do you read me?
Very funny.
Very little.
We can't leave the car here!
We're gonna get caught. No doubt about it.
We're gonna get nabbed, for sure.
What about Rooney?
What do you think Ferris is gonna do?
What guy?
What is it?
What is this shit?
What were you in a previous life?
What'd I do?
What's spooky is they still control everything. They took over when they were young and they never gave it up.
Why'd you hit me?
Why'd you hit me?!
Why'd you hit me?!
Yeah, but to do what?
Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick and piss on the hood.
Yeah.
Yeah. As long as I've known him, everything works for him. There's nothing he can't handle. I can't handle anything. School, parents, the future. Ferris can do anything.
Yeah. Sort of.
Yeah. Sure.
You already did it. If I need it again, I'll use it.
You could change.
You do it!
You hit me. Look, don't ask me to participate in your crap if you don't like the way I do it!
You know, this is all very interesting but I'm starving.
You need a blood test.
You oughta be sorry for Christ's sake! A family member dies and you insult me. What's the matter with you, anyway?
You're serious?
I think I see my car.
No.
...You're not talking me into this one. I have to live with the man. I'm sorry but...
I can't. I'm sick.
I don't have to try.
Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?
On second thought, I don't have time to talk to you. We'll get together soon and have lunch.
Pardon my French but you're an asshole!
You have reached the Coughlin Bros. Mortuary. We are unable to come to the phone right now but if you'll leave your name and number...
AH!
He has an incredible story.
His name is Ferris Mueller.
How did you get picked for this.
I don't know who that was or what they were playing but I apologize for it nonetheless.
Sorry about that.
A very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller.
Can you stay around and take a few phone calls?
I wish you the best of luck.
Are you also aware that Ferris does not have what we consider an exemplary attendance record?
I just had his file up.
Oh, Sloane! Dear!
As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney.
I have a delivery.
Gotta run.
Howdy!
Nobody's home here?
You gonna be around for awhile?
You wanna keep an eye on these?
It's very good here.
Much better here than in Russia.
One year.
You want a lift?
I NEED A TOWEL!!
IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN? SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN? TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?
Don't pay any attention to him. He thinks it's cute to bait adults.
Where's my wallet?!
I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective...
I'm so worried about falling behind.
Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've won our freedom, we're traveling down one of American's most scenic polluted waterways and you have to bring up nuclear war?
Cameron's never been in love. At least no one's ever been in love with him. He's gonna marry the first girl he lays.
And she's gonna treat him like shit because he's gonna kiss her ass for giving him what he's built-up in his mind as the end-all, be-all of human existance.
She won't respect him because you can't respect someone who kisses your ass. It just doesn't work.
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and my personal favorite, Indiana.
This is the world's tallest building. From our vantage point here on the 103 floor, we are provided with a view of four states.
We don't know when the bombs going off. We do know, however, that college starts in the fall.
...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid containing digestive enzymes? The home of the world famous isles of Langerhans?
40,000 restaurants in the downtown area and I pick the one my father goes to.
A man with priorities so far out of whack doesn't deserve such a fine automobile.
A sample of my blood was sent to Atlanta to the Center for Disease Control. I don't know, man, I'm bricking heavily.
AH!
Alright, look, this is real simple.
An hour ago you wanted to yack.
And look down.
I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA GIRLS!
And what is you loathe somebody? Are you going to say "love" every time you see them?
And you thought we wouldn't have any fun. Shame on you.
Are you suggesting that I'm not who I say I am?
As in the gland that has important functions in digestion and metabolism?
Ask for Abe Frohman.
Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right.
Bathroom.
Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol and get dressed. You're boring me with this stuff.
Besides being too young and your father hating my guts and not having any place to live and feeling awkward about being the only cheerleader with a husband, give me a good reason why not.
Better than Russia?
Bueller. Ferris Bueller.
BUY!
By the way, I borrowed some cash from you. I'll pay you back.
Cameron looks like a toddler, for Christ's sake. I'm talking about a major achievement in false identification.
CAMERON!
Cameron, are you okay? It's no problem, really. Your old man won't know a thing. It's completely fixable.
Cameron, dear friend?
Cameron, if you're not over here in fifteen minutes, you can find a new best friend. I'm serious, man.
This is bullshit, making me wait around the house for you.
Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jam you. It was uncalled for.
Cameron, the more obvious we are, the less likely we are to get caught.
Cameron, what'd you see today?
Cameron?
Cameron? Do you think this because of the car or is it a combination of everything shitty in your life?
Cameron? How many miles did you say this thing had when we left?
Cameron? It's my Dad.
Cameron? One quick question. Why'd you do that?
Cameron'll go on like that for a good thirty minutes. The guy is a shellfish when it comes to making a decision.
The reason he doesn't fell good is, he worries about everything. He's the only guy I know who's deeply concerned that when he grows up there'll be a critical shortage of strategic metals.
Cameron's also the only guy I know who knows what strategic metals are.
Cameron's home life is really shit. He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick all the time. It really upsets him.
What he said about his parents hating each other? I refuse to sleep over at his house. His parents fight all the time. Even when I'm there.
Is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting? It's the absolute height of social discomfort.
Cash.
Check, please!
Clearly you've never been to an American high school.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON! COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT!
Dad? Can you hold on a second?
Darling, you were wonderful.
Dead serious.
Death.
Do you love me?
Do you realize that if I played by the rules, right now I'd be in gym?
Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave us to our repast and all will be forgotten.
Either would I.
Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right?
Financing my activities this way. Very damaging to the self-image. But, hey, I'm broke. In times of crisis one must to what one must to. I'll pay it back. With interest.
Frightening choice of words.
Give yourself some credit, Dad. It was a mammoth gesture. It's like those savings bonds you used to give me every Christmas.
Good?
Great. I want to you take extra special care of this vehicle, okay?
Guten tag, dude!
Have a nice day.
He doesn't trust you?
Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?
Hello.
Hellos' generic.
He's cool. But stay away from his brother.
He's full of shit. All the old hippies are full of shit.
Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix it.
H--hell-o?
His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him.
I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her.
It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her.
Honey, you lies when you said you loved me and I had no cause to doubt you. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you.
Now, the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around and if you won't come back to me, then they can bring the curtain down...
How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's going to be there with her?!
Huh?
Hurry along now!
I appreciate it.
I can't believe you'd think up something like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi right in front of you.
I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people.
I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.
I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit.
I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school?
I don't have an explanation.
I have a agree with you there.
I have a growth on my brain that causes memory lapses. Could you tell me what we ordered here?
I have a test today. I have to take it. I want to get into a good college so I can have a fruitful life...
I have an idea. If you're interested.
I rest my case.
I think I broke my thumb.
I think it's a land-based beefoid creature.
I think this could work.
I thought that might be a problem. Let's crack open the odometer and roll it back by hand.
I want to.
I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?
I was going to say I knew Springsteen's home phone number and I was going to give out the number of the New Jersey State Police but I thought I might get busted.
After I got flunked in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail box, which was not in any way, shape or from my fault.
I was putting out a cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.
I wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals? Probably not many women.
I'd like to cash these in, please. We're having a baby and we need the cash for a crib, clothes, diapers, food pellets, leash, water dish...
If anybody needs a day off, it's Cameron. He has alot of things to sort out before he graduates.
He can't be wound this tight and go to college. His roommate'll kill him. I've come close myself. But I like him.
He's a little easier to take when you know why he's like he is. The boy cannot relax.
Pardon by French but Cameron is so tight that if you stuck a lump of coal up his ass, in two weeks you'd have a diamond.
I'll be okay. I'll just sleep. Maybe I'll have an aspirin around noon.
I'll call you tonight.
I'll do it, if you will.
I'll give the guy a five to watch it.
I'm Abe Frohman.
I'm aware of that.
I'm being tested here.
I'm game.
I'm going to tell a massive lie here. It's going to by very thick and very steamy.
I think radio's a facinating medium, it challenges the imagination. Unlike television which provides the images, radio...
I'm much better, really. Please, don't make me stay home again. I want to go to school. I'm graduating in June and I...
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!
I'm so disappointed in Cameron. Twenty bucks says he's sitting in his car debating about whether or not he should go out.
I'm taking the day off. Get dressed and come over.
Impossible. You're doing great.
In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue.
Incredible! One of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second.
Is that Jeanie? I can't see that far. Jeanie?
Is there a problem?
It is his fault he didn't lock the garage.
It was risky, it was bold but it was totally necessary.
It's a piece of shit. Don't worry about it. I don't even have a piece of shit. I have to envy yours. Look, I'm sorry but there's nothing else we can do.
It's all in your head. Come on over.
It's completely cool.
It's completely cool. He's just checking up on me. Now, listen to me. I'm working on getting some heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you can do is hurry up and get over here. Bye.
It's cool.
It's kind of a long story but I've been doing alot of programming for NASA.
It's nice to know I have such loving, caring parents. You're both very special people.
It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European.
So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car.
Just a little phlegm on the phone. Hold on.
Just out of curiosity, what was your top speed coming down the ramp?
Lean over and grab a fish.
Let's go feed Cameron.
Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe he wasn't bullshitting himself.
Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend. A parent. A child...
Maybe you're right, Dad.
Me?
Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb you at work but I was wondering if it would be possible for my sister to bring home any assignments from my classes that I may need.
My best friend has flipped-out. Conventional wisdom would suggest a visit to the nearest trauma center. I wouldn't fault anybody for doing that.
My, personally, I think this calls for something new, something bold, something wet and wild.
My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories.
Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not.
My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?"
My, God, you're so stupid!
No way, Cameron. Only the meek get nabbed. The bold survive. Let's go.
No, but Kimberly's is.
No, Cameron. You wrecked a car.
No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the government. They need it. Do you know what an aircraft carrier's going for these days?
No. I'm just real loose.
No. She's saying it's time for lunch.
Not a chance in the world.
Not a glimmer.
Not that I condone fascism. Or and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an "ism". He should believe in himself.
John Lennon said it on his first solo album. "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.
Now, lean against the glass. Like this...
Nuclear spring.
Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're just trying to cheer me up.
One of the most frightening experiences of my young life has been observing my parents and our neighbors playing the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits.
It's chilling to see people crazed with the minutia of their past.
One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act.
Out in front my herself? It's too suspicious! He'll think something's up, moron. Cover it.
Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school.
Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie. Be thankful that you're fit and have your health. Cherish it.
Point well taken. But consider why she does it. Why she does it and you don't.
Regardless of how much shit sisters make you eat, how often they rat on you, how gross they act or how wicked and insensitive they can be, you should not alientate them.
Because most likely they have cash and it's usually very easy to get your hands on.
See what a finski can do to a person's attitude? He's going to treat it like a beautiful woman.
She's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured. Her body is a transport vehicle for her anger. I don't know where she gets this shit. Basically, the family's pretty cool.
She's probably schizophrenic.
Sloane is naked before your eyes and you're thinking about words?
Sloane's a bigger problem. She still has another year of high school. How do I deal with that?
I was serious when I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't just teenage infatuation. That's what my parents call it. What do they call what they have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation.
So, Yuri, how long have you been in America?
So...
So?
Some guy whose hair is falling out and his stomach's hanging over his belt and everything he eats makes him fart. 
He looks at someone like me and thinks, "This kid's young and strong and has a full, rich future ahead of him, what's he got to bitch about?"
Sorry, Dad. The moment before you called, I had a chest spasm and I blew lung fluid all over the place.
It was making me ill looking at it. But gee, it's sure great of you to call. I'm sure there're alot of fathers who wouldn't take time out from their busy schedules to call a dumb, sick teenager.
Splendid.
Squeeze you buns for a second. I got another call.
Stunning!
Superb.
Sure. He had to so it, I guess. His old man had it coming. He'll be okay. I'd be worried if he'd taken my idea.
Take a step back...
Talk!
Thank you.
Thanks, Jeanie.
That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food.
I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out.
That hurts, Cameron.
That I care about it was.
That's just one reason why I need a day off every now and then.
The adult mind is a suspicious machine.
The question isn't "what are we gonna do", the question is "what aren't we going to do."
There's alot of pressure at work in my age group. And it's not always recognized.
They bought it.
They used to have Viet Nam. They used to have the oil crisis stuff and Iran. That's over and people have to have their big issue.
It's not like somebody came up with the nuclear holocaust yesterday at noon, you know.
This is a big U-2 fan.
This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count.
This is optomism. It's a common trait with my age group. Adults think it's cute, it's like a charming quick that infests youth.
But it's a cool thing and I think, deep down, crusty old shits wish they had some. They wish they had her, too.
This is perfect top-down weather.
This is probably the last time you'll have to ride back here. Keep that in mind.
This is really degrading.
This may very well be for real. I think Cameron might have blown a micro-chip or two. He's always been a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do was give him a good day.
We're gonna graduate in a couple of months. Then we have the summer. He'll work and I'll work.
And we'll see each other at night and on the weekends but then he'll go to one school and I'll go to another. And basically that'll be it.
As much as we like each other, the process of growing up will separate us.
To fix this situation, I'm going to have to ask you for a small favor.
Tomorrow?
True.
TWIST AND SHOUT!
Uh, huh. And what might that be?
Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost.
It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station.
Upstairs, Mom!
Vaguely.
...I'm the first Chicago area youth to be selected to participate in a space shuttle mission.
Cameron! What's happening?
Have a nice day.
Have a nice day.
Home.
How do you feel?
I appreciate your conern for my well-being. It will be remembered long after...
I was trying to do some homework.
I'd really like to but I have a kidney  operation in about an hour.
I'm sorry but I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid...
I'm sorry I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid that in my weakened condition, I could take a nasty spill down the stairs and subject myself to further school absenses.
I'm sorry I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid that in my weakened condition...
I'm sorry that I can't come to the door right now...
I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come on over and pick me up.
Is your mother in the room?
My input on the Star Wars defense plan was pretty substantial so I guess this is their way of rewarding me. I'm pretty flattered.
Really? Darn! I thought I was improving.
Thank you, sir.
Thanks, Steve.
VOICE Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
You can reach my parents at their places of business. Thank you for stopping by. I appreciate your concern for my well-being. It will be remembered long after this illness has past.
You may reach my parents at their places of business.
You're not dying. You just can't think of anything good to do.
You're not up for some good times? It's a beautiful day. It's almost summer. If this was Hawaii, we'd be surfing.
We can't pick up Sloane in your car, Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr. Peterson drives that piece of shit.
We have enough cash left for a quick flight to Peoria and back.
WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW!
What are you doing?
What was that about?
What?!
Whatever miles we put on it, we'll take off.
What's he care about now?
What's your overall impression?
When they go after each other, Cameron tightens up. It's scary. He gets so wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns apart with a crowbar.
The thing with taking his old man's car? It's good for him. It teaches him to deal with his fear. Plus, and I must be honest here, I love driving it. I highly recommend picking one up.
Where's your brain?
Where's your brain?!
Where's your brain?!
Who is it?
Why not?
Why not?
Would I have introduced you as my wife if I didn't love you?
Would I risk damaging a deep and wonderfully enriching relationship with my parents if I didn't love you?
Would I trash a day of education to be with you if I didn't love you?
Would you want to get married? I mean if I wasn't an asshole.
Yeah, really.
Yeah. It was pretty cool.
Years of practice.
Yes.
Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of three for 12:00.
Yes. You?
Yo, Clouseau!
You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun.
You did screw up through, right? Not that is was necessarily all you fault. Right?
You don't have to, Dad.
You don't think it's amazing that we got in?
You feeling any better, Cameron?
You got me. I don't speak French.
You gotta get one.
You had to work hard for the money to buy those things, right?
You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy.
You just can't deal with anymore shit? The car took you into the red zone? Time for a reality check?
You know, someone said the world's a stage and each must play a part. Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. Act one was when we met. I loved you at first glance.
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue. Then came act two. You seemed to change. You acted strange. And why, I've never known.
You saw four states, a submarine, a giant heart, seventy five dollars worth of cooked pancreas, two of the most incredible breasts ever to come out of modern plastics, major league baseball and...
You speak English?
You think I don't care?
You touch me and I yell "rat!" There's another phone around here. Find it.
You trashed the car.
You want to leave? We just got here.
You want to stay home and try to have the shits? Try to barf? Try to feel worse?
You win some, you lose some.
You work so hard I'll bet you don't even remember where those bonds are, right?
You're father's a toad and your Mom's always wired out, but so what? They're old. That's natural.
It's kind of like being in the belly of the beast isn't it?
Everybody thinks you're an asshole.
I didn't mean it that way.
I don't know. Just forget it.
I don't think you're an asshole.
I think he's cute.
Maybe if you didn't cat like and asshole...
Not everybody thinks you're an asshole. Mr. Rooney likes you.
Somebody who threatens to sock people's tits has a problem.
Take a walk, Jeanie.
Why? What's the point?
You really do have a problem, Jeanie.
A whole bunch of people. They said he's like on the verge of death.
Gummi Bear?
Hello?
I'll bet you never smelled a real school bus before.
I'm really sorry about your brother.
No, I mean I heard he's really sick.
They've been in pocket. They're real soft and warm.
This guy in my biology class said that if Ferris dies he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's really sweet isn't he?
Yeah, why?
SHAKE IT UP, BABY
TWIST AND SHOUT!
Here.
Here.
He's sick.
WORK IT ON OUT!
Cubs.
Zero to zero.
Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?
Yeah, right. Dry that one out and you can fertilize the lawn.
Ferris Bueller's days are numbered.
Alright. How about if I sock your face?
Alright. If you've got the time, I've got the troubles. In a nutshell, I hate my brother. How's that?
Am I acting like an asshole?
Basically.
Blow yourself.
Can you imagine someone as sick as Ferris trying to walk home from the hospital?
Do you know a guy named Garth Volbeck?
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Forget that everybody thinks I'm an asshole? Would you like everybody to think you're an asshole?
Go piss up a flagpole!
He's gone. He's over. He's monkey meat.
Hi.
I can't believe my brother's making me put myself in a position where I could get expelled. Selfish little moron.
I don't know why I'm here.
I knew it!
I this a conspiracy to shit all over me or something? Is my brother behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll sock your tits.
I went home to confirm that the shithead was ditching school and a guy broke into the house and I called the cops and they picked me up for making a phoney phone call.
I'd get caught.
If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose a testicle.
I'm gonna microwave his nuts...
I'm saved! Thank you, God! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I'm sorry I've been riding your buns for so long.
Is Dean Rooney in?
Is he cool?
Is Mrs. Bueller there? Where is she? This is her daughter. Do you know where she is? Do you know when she'll be back? Do you know anything?
It's real nice that you hope my brother's feeling better but I'm in danger, okay? I'm very cute, I'm very alone and I'm very protective of my body. I'd rather not have it violated or killed. I need 
help!
It's reprehensible to squeal on your own flesh and blood...but it's for his own good. His cavalier attitude will get him into trouble later in life...
and it'll continue to piss me off and I'll get so wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer and he'll ruin my life. Screw him.
Jean. What's yours?
Let me tell you something. I study hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm considerate, I'm friendly and fair to all kinds of people. Except morons.
I try to be everything a good, decent person should be and you know what?
Me? I have a problem?
No problem.
No, not yet.
No, thank you. I'm straight.
Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat fifty year old clod with B.O. likes me.
OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!!
Pucker up and squat, Ferris.
Rachel?
Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else?
See? My brother strokes you, you sympathize with him, I get pissed off and this is what happens!
Sweetie, it's an established fact that you have no taste. Ferris is not cute. He's not charming. He's not nice. He's not a wonderful person.
He's an ignorant mule and the sooner everybody in this school comes to that realization the better off we'll all be.
Thank God, you're alright! We've been worried sick!
Thank...you...
The worm has luck like clams have body odor...
This is not a phoeny phone call. There's an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed, certainly weird, in our kitchen.
What're you sorry for? I have to live with the trouser snake.
Who does?
WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!!
Who said he's sick.
Why are you here?
Why don't you put your thumb up your butt?
Why should he get to ditch school when everybody else has to go?
Why? Because I'm sick of the little dope. He manipulates my parents, he does whatever he wants, whenever he wants and he never gets nailed.
With you? Are you serious?
Would everybody be happier if maybe I were to die in a flaming car accident or something?
You don't have to.
You don't have to. I've been ripping off your wallet for years.
You really want to know what's wrong?
You're not falling for this, are you? Tell me you're not falling for this.
Excuse me. If whoever's in the house is still in the house, I'd like you to know that I have just called the police. If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll get your ass out of my house real quick.
I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun. And a scorching case of herpes.
Ferris!
We love you, sweetie.
Did I tell you I have a son your age?
Do you know my son?
Don't "hi" me, young lady. Get your stuff.
Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.
Get downstairs! Now!
Get downstairs! NOW!
Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right down.
He doesn't feel well.
He doesn't have a fever. But he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.
His name is Ferris. I think you'd like him.
Honey?
How did you get so sweet?
I can give you every assurance that Ferris is home and that he is, in fact, very ill. I debated whether or not I should even leave him.
I can appreciate that at this time of year children are prone to taking the day off, but in Ferris' case, he's truly a very sick boy.
I hope so. I appreciate your calling me. I can assure you that her father and I will have a long talk with her.
I hope you feel better, pumpkin.
If you're willing to commit a little time and a little money to this place, you can really have something to be proud of. Don't let the black living room throw you off.
Joyce Bueller.
Mrs. Froeling, how are you?
My son's home sick today. If you wouldn't mind, on our way back to the office, I'd like to just run in and check up on him.
No one's going to consider a house with a black living room. Not even those jerks from Vermont. Let's be realistic.
Not that I know of.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot to call.
She's never been in trouble before. This is a shock to me. First, I don't know why she wasn't at school. Second, I don't know why she'd call you with this story about a rapist.
Thank you.
You're not going to school like this.
I don't understand.
Nine times?
This is all news to me.
Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I had a meeting first thing this morning. I should have called. It completely slipped my mind.
Heartless wench...
Hey, babe! Some day you might need a favor from Ferris Bueller! Then where'll you be?!
Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing?
Huh?
They run about fifty g's so it you could help out...
Yo. We're collecting money to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney.
A WATERMELON!
If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.
Is my head swelling up?
Myocardial infarction?
Oh, shit!
Syphilitic meningitus? That would be a huge family embarrassment.
WaitHold still!
KIMBERLY You heads starting to swell up!!
TO YOUR LEFT IT THE WORLD'S TALLEST BUILDING...
Enjoy your luncheon.
I appreciate your understanding.
Shall I call the police?
You're Abe Frohman?
Are you aware that your son is not in school today?
Ed? This is George Peterson.
We've had a bit of bad luck this morning as you may have heard.
Of course.
Watch your mouth.
I passed a kidney stone Tuesday.
She told me everything. Keep me posted, I'll want to send a gift.
TWIST A LITTLE CLOSER!
May I see you outside for a moment? There's been an emergency.
Sloane Peterson?
For whatever reasons she did it, I think she'd had a good scare.
Oh, by the way, I hope you son's feeling better.
Tell him, all the guys at the station here are pulling for him.
AHHHHH!
YOU KNOW YOU LOOK SO GOOD!
AH!
LOOK SO GOOD!
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Your ass is mine.
Absolutely! I most certainly am.
And I'm going to stop it!
B.S. Come down here.
Could you get me Mr. Peterson's daytime number?
Dead grandmother?
Don't get smart with me Ferris!
Ed Rooney.
Ferris Bueller's behind this. There's no doubt in my mind. That's what I was saying this morning. Why he has to be stopped. He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this thing now. See?
How are you today, sir?
How does another year of high school sit with you?
I don't know. I thought you were someone else. You have to know, sir, that I would never deliberately insult you. I can't begin to tell you how embarrassed I am.
I don't trust this kid any further than I can throw him!
I got you, Ferris. This time I finally got you.
I have it right here in front of me. He's missed...
I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken up. Huh? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to release Sloane. You produce a corpse and I'll release Sloane. I want to see this dead grandmother firsthand.
I imagine so.
I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller.
If Ferris thinks he coast this last month and still graduate, he's sorely mistaken.
I'll tell you want, you don't like my policies, you can just come on down and smooch by big old ugly ass. You hear me?
I'm not leaving until you come down and talk to me.
I'm not leaving, Ferris.
Looking for this?
No.
Once again let me say how deeply saddened I am by your loss.
Really?
Sleep tight, pooch.
Something's going on, goddamn it.
That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you worthless mutt!
That's exactly why I have to catch him this time. To show these kids that the example he sets is a first class ticket to nowhere.
This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd like to have a word with you.
Were you close to your grandmother?
What!?
What?
What's so dangerous about a character like Ferris Bueller is that he gives the good kids bad ideas.
The last thing I need at this point in my career is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls.
What's the score?
Who gives a good goddamn?
Who's this girl's going with?
Who's winning?
Load and clear, Mr. Peterson.
Sir.
So far this semester alone, he's been absent nine times. Including today.
Ferris Bueller. You know him?
No.
What?
And her grandmother, too.
Do you still want his number?
Ed Rooney's office.
Edward Rooney's office.
Ferris Bueller's on line two.
Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering you now?
He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers, richies, they all adore him.
Hold, please.
I don't know. He left the grounds on personal business.
I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you?
It's Mr. Peterson.
It's so hard to tell. I see her alot with Ferris Bueller.
My brother-in-law rides the train to work.
My brother-in-law'll appreciate it.
That's what Mr. Peterson said. I had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.
There's a railroad strike.
This is the Peterson's home.
Watch your mouth this time.
With your bad knee, you better not throw anybody, Ed.
YOU IDIOT!!
Dad? All this talking has made me kind of light-headed. I think I better lie down.
Don't you think it's an issue because people need something to worry about? They have to like, have some major problem that puts all their little bullshit into some kind of persepective?
It is kind of raggy subject, Cam.
To answer your question...No, I'm not worried about it at all.
Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real cold and the skiing's for shit.
A girl can always bail out and have a baby and get some guy to support her.
Actually, we're hoping for a car.
Agreed.
Baldness, fatty meats and money.
Cameron! Cut it out! What's wrong?! Ferris!
Cameron? I could flip real easy, too. There's nothing wrong with it. At one time or another, everybody goes to the zoo.
Cameron's right. We're gonna get busted.
Can we leave now?
College.
Come on, Ferris, answer his question.
Consider this...my father canned me and my brother and my Mom for a twenty five year old dipso with fake tits. He dropped us like a rock.
Everything was cool at our house. I thought so. We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over.
Cool.
Do they like you?
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Do you believe that you lived before?
DO you ever wonder what you were?
Do you love me?
Do you think they're staying together because of you?
Ferris, this is nauseating me. Really. I'm losing respect for you by the bucket.
Ferris?
From the A-Team?
God bless you, Cameron.
He says I don't care about things like he did.
He's gonna marry me. I know it.
Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?
Huh?
I asked you first.
I could see him ignoring popular belief and taking off on some impossible mission.
I don't know. But it looks like it's already been eaten and digested.
I guess that's my Dad. Thanks. See ya.
I had a great time today.
I love him.
I LOVE YOU!
I think if he was anybody, he was Magellan. You know, the guy who went around the world.
I'd say...
I'm not a tramp.
I'm not getting married.
I'm not interested in watching someone jiggle their mammary glands.
I'm not sure but I think I know who Ferris was.
I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially looking forward to wearing those jeans with the stretch panel in front.
It's better than "hello".
Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been a good sport.
Love.
Me either.
My parents are divorced. So what? It's not like it doesn't happen ten thousand times a day.
My step-father's always going off about how when he was young he was committed to all these causes.
No way!
No wonder you're always sick.
No. It's not something I can get comfortable with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?
Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher.
Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to be so graphic?
Oh, shit!
Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah.
Sloane Peterson
Really.
Roast!
Shut-up! It is a problem! For him it's a problem. Nothing's a problem for you. But it's a problem for him! So, just shut-up.
Sure.
The future's worse for a boy, isn't it?
The water's really nice. I wish you'd come in.
They call the shots. When you split from them, you call the shots.
This has to be a dream.
This is so great! I can't believe it! Right in front of Rooney!
This is so right!
True, but it's an option. No options is worse.
Wait a minute. That was a lie.
We can't come to the phone right now. We've had a death in the family. If you need to reach us we'll be at the following number...
We could go to my house. My parents aren't coming home until late.
Well, you know what? It ain't up to you. It's out of your hands.
What a fabulous car!
What about your one word?
What are you interested in?
What can I do, Cameron?
What comes after a nuclear winter?
What could happen to it?
What do you mean, why not? Think about it.
What if the glass gives?
What?
What?
What?
What're we gonna do?
What's next.
What's so funny?
Who wants to get in?
Why?

Can you feel my power?
One shot and the world gets smaller.
Let's jump upon the sharp swords and cut away our smiles.

You'll understand when I'm dead.
Each thing I show you is a piece of my death.

Take your hatred out on me.
Make your victim my head!
You never ever believed in me.
Go ahead and kill a dead messiah, we can dig another grave.
This is your calling.

And I have seen it.
It is hard and cold.
It has been dormant for many years.
We are trying to save you and I have come to save you.
This is what you deserve, this is what we deserve.
This is something we have brought upon ourselves.
We are not a victim, you are not a victim.
God will grovel before me.
God will crawl at my feet.
And the time is this.
And the time is...
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you.
When will you realize you're already there?
So watered down, your feelings have turned to mud.
"Love everybody" is destroying the value of all hate.
I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping away...
Oh no, it is everything they said it was...
Oh no, I am all the things they said I was...
When you get to Heaven, you will wish you're in hell!
When will you realize, you're already here?
You'll thank us now that you have crossed over.
Don't pick the scabs or you will never heal.
The world shudders as the worm gets his wings.

It's a chopper, baby, hop on.
I said goddamn!
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
No.
Butch my love, the adventure begins
Sleep well, Butch.
I didn't.
Yes.
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?
Is she the hysterical type? When she due? Give me the principals' names again? Jules....
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. White. Nothin', except for the mess inside. About twenty minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe.
See ya soon. How we comin', Jimmie?
What's I tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive.
If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive.
Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.
How many bookies you spread it around with? Eight? How long to collect? So by tomorrow evening, you'll have it all?
Good news Scotty, real good news -- I understand a few stragglers aside. Me an' Fabian're gonna leave in the morning.
It should take us a couple days to get into Knoxville. Next time we see each other, it'll be on Tennessee time.
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta bit of a situation.
Not this life.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me.
Just know: you hurt him, you die.
About what?
What?
Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here.
Well it should be!
What?
It's your future: I see...a cab ride. Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
Say goodbye, Raquel
What?
Naw man, I didn't.
Him.
Friend of yours?
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
Do you wanna do this?
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?
No.
Really?! He won't be fighting no more?!
Holy shit.
Is that what I think it is?
Tell her it's gonna be okay.
Mia! Mia! What the hell happened?
Are you the man I was supposed to pick up?
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.
Who?
What?
Anything to drink with that?
I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.
He's cool?
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question.
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about "best intentions."
You were gonna shoot him?
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?
No! It's not your fault. You left it at the apartment.
Fabian my love, our adventure begins.
Everything looks hunky dorie. Looks can be deceiving, but this time I don't think they are. Why waste the manpower to stake out my place.
I'd have to be a fuckin' idiot to come back here. That's how you're gonna beat 'em Butch, they keep underestimating you.
Fuck.
I'll be a sonofabitch. 
Mia! Mia! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?
It's cold.
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.
We should be fuckin' dead right now. Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a real good friend. Good friend, bad husband, soon to be ex-husband.
Who the fuck are you?
Look, what's your name? I got his name's Vincent, but what's yours?
You two are a match made in heaven.
You said you waited for me?
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, I'd be great. What's with the outfits. You guys going to a volleyball game?
Down!
Up!
He's dead! He's dead!
Are they having a moment?
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?
It was good --
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
What?
Wake up!
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet.
Hello! I'm here!
...and ever.
...and he's...he's...tall --
...and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.
...Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he knew Willis was dead?
...Esmarelda Villalobos -- is that Mexican?
...ever seen that show "COPS?"
I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway.
He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens.
...goddamn...goddamn...that was fucked up...goddamn, that was cold- blooded...
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on body piercing.
...it's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.
...three!
...three.
...three.
...two...
...two...
...Vincent...Jimmie...Bonnie....
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya think she'll do? No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't.
How bad, a lot or a little?
...yeah...are you still brushing your teeth?
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.
A foot massage?
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
A lot of people go to restaurants.
A lot of wallets.
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit.
That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.
A shake? Milk and ice cream?
About fifteen hundred dollars.
About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?
Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.
After tonight.
After what a cool guy I've been, I can't believe you do me like this. It's the only thing I asked.
All shapes and sizes, Vince.
All the way?
Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive?
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? No. You're in my house.
White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.
My shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin' week.
An act of God.
And no more liquor stores?
And you believed that?
And...?
Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?!
Any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese --
Anybody want a beer?
Are you a "Bewitched" man, or a "Jeannie" man?
Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house!
Are you Jewish?
Are you mad?
Are you some kinda weirdo?
Are you still retiring?
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
Are you sure?
Are you watchin' it?
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
Asking my side.
At Marsellus' request.
At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.
Baby-love, from the moment I left you, this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about it.
Be my guest.
Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.
Because it's a lot of fun.
Because of the metric system?
Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.
Better you than me, gentlemen.
Betty. I never understood Veronica attraction.
Big Kahuna Burger.
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
Bitch gonna kill more niggers than time.
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke.
Blueberry pie.
Bon soir, Esmarelda.
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all this will be hers.
Bring out The Gimp.
But did it happen?
But I do not speak Spanish.
But they won't find us, will they?
But what about all our bags?
But why?
But you first.
Butch, I was so worried!
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
Butch.
Butch.
Butch.
Butch. What does it mean?
Butch?
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
Bye.
Bye-bye, sugar pop.
Call me Winston.
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
Can I help you wit' somethin'?
Can't we just take it to a friendly place?
'Cause if push met shove, you know I'll take care of business. But push ain't never gonna meet shove. Because You're gonna solve this shit for us.
You're gonna take our asses outta the cold and bring it inside where it's warm.
'Cause if I gotta get into it with my friend about his wife over your boy Vincent, I'm gonna have bad feelings.
'Cause I'm a boxer. And after you've said that, you've said pretty much all there is to say about me.
Now maybe that son-of-a- bitch tonight was once at one time a boxer. If he was, then he was dead before his ass ever stepped in the ring.
I just put the poor bastard outta his misery. And if he never was a boxer -- That's what he gets for fuckin' up my sport.
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business!
Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. What's in this?
Check.
Cheeseburgers.
Chill out, honey!
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens.
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?
C'mon, don't be that way.
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and jokin' our way into prison. Don't make me beg.
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets?
C'mon, Mr. Wolf....
Come again?
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow?
Contre senior Lobo.
Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck.
they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register.
Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner.
Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
One minute they're havin' a Denver omelette, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?
Count to three.
Counting our guy?
Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.
Cut. Print. Let's go eat.
Deal!
Deal.
Did everything go as planned?
Did it work?
Did they hurt the little girl?
Did ya think of something to say?
Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?
Did you get everything, sugar pop?
Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
Die...die...die...die...!
Die...die...die...die...die...die!
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?
Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing?
Do you have a different idea?
Do you know that a miracle is?
Do you know who we are?
Do you love me?
Do you remember any of the jokes?
Do you still want me to go with you?
Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?
Does it have to be exact?
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!
Donde esta el zapataria?
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread it around.
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages -- I'm the fuckin' foot master.
Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you.
Don't blaspheme!
Don't bring her here! I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh- butt to my house!
Don't call me retard.
Don't do shit unless --
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do that! Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin' miracle!
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you. I love you, remember? Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast.
Don't go.
Don't mention it.
Don't play with me, you said somethin', now what was it?
Don't take any chances. Execute him!
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you.
Don't worry, I will.
Don't worry, we're takin' it with us. Jim, the soap.
Don't yell and me!
Don't you hate that?
Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
Eleven.
Emma Peel on "The Avengers." That tough girl who usta hang out with Encyclopedia Brown. And Arlene Motika.
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it?
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!
Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!
Everybody say Pepsi.
Examples?
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my little mama ceta in no time.
Expect a call around 10:30. It's about thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.
Fabian, I want you to be with me.
Fabian, I'm not lying to you, I don't remember.
Fabian, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?...
I don't wanna get into it right now...but he went through a lot.
Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it?
Fair enough. I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up. If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.
Feel better?
Filters?
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet.
Floyd retired too.
Forever?
Forget it.
Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing.
All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.
Five in each ear. One through the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril. One through my left eyebrow. One through my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud in my tongue.
Forty-five sixty.
'Fraid I can't do that.
Friend of yours?
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train if we don't split now.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a finger.
Fuckin' keyed it.
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing.
Garcon! Coffee!
Garcon! Coffee!
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me.
Vincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if we cross the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. What did I say?
Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenalin shot.
Get the fuckin' shot!
Girl from sixth grade, you don't know her.
Give me three hundred worth of the madman. If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand.
Given a lot of 'em?
Giving me oral pleasure?
Go on now, get your ass outta here.
Goddammit, Jules --
Goddammit, what is it?
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice.
You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this?
Goddamn!
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake I don't know if it's worth five Handlung dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!
Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen.
Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.
Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that. What'cha eatin'?
Good job.
Good, 'cause we got one.
Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery -- now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off in. Give it a good once over.
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.
But the windows are a different story.
Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet.
I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em.
We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets.
If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal.
Jimmie -- lead the way, boys -- get to work.
Goodbye, Raquel.
Got it.
Got it.
Got it.
Guilty.
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.
Hamburgers.
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?
Hand back for a second or two, and when you see the white boy leave, go on over. In the meanwhile, can I make you an espresso?
Handlung
Have you ever fantasized about being beaten up by a girl?
Have you ever given a foot massage?
Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?
Have you looked?
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone --
Have you met Mia?
He booked.
He fell out of a window.
He gave her a foot massage.
Hello, Boyfriend!
Hello, Girlfriend. I swear, heartbreaker, Joe should change the name of this place to Beauty and the Beast Truck and Tow.
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard a bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your Daddy's.
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together.
Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.
If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim.
But the way it worked out is I'm talkin' to you, Butch. I got somethin' for ya.
Here?
Here? It's a coffee shop.
He's dead?
He's over there, finishing up some business.
Hey hillbilly.
Hey kids.
Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.
Hey, how do I open the window back here?
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of this place?
Hey, mister?
Hi I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?
Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.
Hold hands, you love birds.
Hold on.
Honey, grab your radio and your purse and let's go!
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.
How 'bout a cup of just plain ol' American?
How 'bout an upgrade, you dispose a whole body for the price of a body part.
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?
How did Marsellus and her meet?
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or bloody as hell?
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos and Andy?
How long do you intend to walk the earth?
How many up there?
How many?
How should I know, you were the one watchin' it.
How you boys doin'?
Huhng?
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!
I ain't fer sure yet.
I ain't fuckin' sayin' Pepsi.
I ain't gonna do this. This is a punchy move and I ain't punchy! Daddy would totally fuckin' understand.
If he was here right now, he'd say, "Butch, git a grip. It's a fuckin' watch, man. You lose one, ya git another.
This is your life you're fuckin' around with, which you shouldn't be doin' 'cause you only got one.
I ain't hungry.
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine.
I ain't no model.
I ain't your friend, palooka.
I am, if you'll let me.
I apologize for bein' in your shit like I was.
I believe so....
I can dig it.
I can't believe that's the same car.
I can't wait.
I did.
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called you a retard, but I took it back.
I didn't hear you.
I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident.
I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly.
I didn't say shit. Let's go to work.
I don't eat dog either.
I don't even have an opinion.
I don't feel the least little bit bad. You wanna know why, Esmarelda?
I don't give a damn if he does.
I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.
I don't know what that was. Music and drinks!
I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up.
I don't know! Stop bothering me!
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me!
I don't know.
I don't know. I couldn't understand you.
I don't know. There probably never was a little girl -- the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.
I don't like this photograph shit.
I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me.
I don't smile in pictures.
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep?
I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other.
I don't understand --
I don't understand --
I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' "ifs." What I wanna hear from your ass is: "you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.
Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly."
I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them.
And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations.
Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum.
Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance --
I don't watch TV.
I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress.
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
I dunno, some medical book.
I get the "I'm with Stupid" shirt.
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red.
Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow.
I got no problem with that.
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
I gotta stab her?
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.
I guess you just gotta know how to wear them.
I guess.
I have character.
I have moments.
I have to do it.
I haven't seen you in a long time. I miss you, we're going to breakfast. So it is written, so shall it be done.
I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat.
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think of Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high?
I just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace.
When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions --
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know? Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it.
It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?
I knew you could. First question, Brady Bunch or the Partridge Family?
I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but --
I love you, Honey Bunny.
I love you, Pumpkin.
I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!
Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said:
"We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
I meant what now, between me and you?
I might've broke my nose, no biggie. Hop on.
I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great.
I need a big fat magic marker, got one?
I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin' O.D.ing on me.
I never had to use it. I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers, all of my friends can handle their highs!
I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?
I never saw a medical book.
I promise.
I remember him.
I said a "please" would be nice.
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.
I seriously doubt that.
I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
I think I cracked a rib.
I think I know who you mean, what about him?
I think The Gimp's asleep.
I think we oughta leave now.
I think we should be going now.
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.
I think you're gonna find -- when all this shit is over and done -- I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.
Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last.
Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about.
This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine.
Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be? Feather- weight champion of the world.
Who gives a shit? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on that.
I think you're taking me out to breakfast.
I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late!
I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares?
But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that...
I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you....
Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.
I wanna dance.
I want to convey Mr. Wallace's gratitude with the help you're providing on this matter.
Let me assure you Jimmie, Mr. Wallace's gratitude is worth having.
I want to know what it feels like to kill a man --
I want you to repeat what you said.
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
I was just dryin' my hands.
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much.
I was looking at myself in the mirror.
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.
I watched you get 'em wet.
I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!
I wish I had a pot.
I won alright.
I would think by now I've earned the equivalent of Frequent Flyer miles.
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.
I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem. What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?
If I had a pot belly, I'd punch you in it.
If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this.
So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.
If it takes forever, I'll wait forever.
If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.
If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?
If you can keep a secret, so can I.
If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you.
You ain't a mind reader.
If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions.
If you need a witness in court, I'll be glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that car.
If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. Then once you do, push down on the plunger.
If you were "Archie," who would you fuck first, Betty or Veronica?
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack.
If you're okay, say something.
If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy you're supposed to pick up.
If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!
I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie.
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off.
I'll do that.
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger -- bloody -- and a five-dollar shake.
I'll just be Jules, Vincent -- no more, no less.
I'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
I'll take care of it.
I'll tell ya what, if you ever need it, I'll dispose of a body part for free.
I'm an American, our names don't mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?
I'm Brett.
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how.
I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One...
I'm curious about that myself.
I'm doin' fine. Handlung
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.
I'm gonna take a piss.
I'm gonna take your Honda.
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is.
I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is. When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit.
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.
I'm not gonna be a bad boy.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
I'm not much of a dancer.
I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do.
That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better.
That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this.
But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever.
I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there.
I'm not sure.
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check?
I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass.
I'm ready.
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie. Everything's fine. Hey, how was breakfast?
I'm sorry, baby-love.
I'm sorry.
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. Maybe I can drop you two off. Where do you live?
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm through.
I'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all --
I'm Vincent, you Mia?
I'm Vincent. And Jimmie, thank a bunch,
In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off?
In the bag.
In the fifth, my ass goes down.
In the fifth, your ass goes down.
Inglewood.
Is everything well? Are we in danger?
Is that a fact?
Is that a fact?
Is that better, sugar pop?
It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know...good company.
It ain't no ballpark either.
Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.
It costs five dollars?
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."
It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.
It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
It won't take a second.
It's a chopper.
It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
It's a very pretty name.
It's all yours, Ringo.
It's beautiful.
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle.
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool.
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed.
We're still just talkin', Tell her we're still cool.
It's just tobacco.
It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out -- no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.
It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.
It's not a date.
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here?
It's possible.
It's ready, I'll tell you what to do.
It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.
It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.
It's there.
It's time, Butch.
It's under the be --
It's under the bed.
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the "ifs."
I've never does this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot.
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot.
I've never does this before.
I've said it before, I'll say it again, your business is always welcome.
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time --
Jesus Christ Almighty!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus, are you okay?
Jimmie --
Jimmie --
Jimmie, have you forgotten about your wife comin' home?
Jimmie?
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him.
Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.
Just checking.
Just chill out.
Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am I. It's almost over, Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
Keep an eye on this one.
Keep the light off.
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!
Killing a man. Beating another man to death with your bare hands.
Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act.
According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.
But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist -- when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy.
And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.
If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.
Knock it off, Julie.
Kooties I can handle.
Lance! The phone's ringing!
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place.
Let him go!
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!
Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?
Let us speak of the unspeakable.
Let's move.
Let's shake on it.
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.
Toss the clothes in Jim's garbage bag.
Like it never happened.
Look at this mess! We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight --
Look mister, this ain't any of your business --
Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ --
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-of-a-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how! Now I think the humane thing to do is put him out of his misery.
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do.
Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks.
That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book.
Lookin' at somethin', friend?
Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty- bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed -- this is the door.
Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four-story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?
Martin and Lewis.
Marvin, I just wanna apologize. I got nothin' to do with this shit. And I want you to know I think it's fucked up.
Marvin, I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
Marvin, what do you make of all this?
Mayonnaise.
Me casa, su casa.
Merci beaucoup.
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little something for the effort.
Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?
Mia!
Mia.
Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?
Mind if I try one of yours?
Most definitely.
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' --
Mr. Wolf.
Mucho gracias.
Mum's the word.
My black fuckin' medical book. It's like a text book they give to nurses.
My black medical book!
My boss' dirty laundry.
My darling, I don't want you to be murdered over a silly watch.
My guess would be yes, Richard. I could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.
I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
My name's Paul, and this is between y'all.
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit.
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!
Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room.
Naw, I don't eat pork.
Negative.
Nick Nolte, of course.
No and, that's it.
No choice.
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're him, tell me you're him.
No it's not, it's just what I heard.
No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change.
They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em.
They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be -- a fuckin' bum!
No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.
No problem?
No retard, from the fight.
No there's not.
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.
No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where?
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you any problem!
No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.
No, it's a subject I have much interest in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?
No, it's not. It's not here.
No, it's Thursday.
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.
No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk -- are you sure you're okay?
No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.
No, you're gonna give her the shot.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No. It's really corny.
No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal.
Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.
If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.
No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed.
Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?
Non.
Nope.
Not a goddamn thing.
Not at all. Being the subject of back-fence gossip goes with the right, I guess.
Not no more.
Not regularly.
Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.
Not yet.
Not yet. I'm going to interview you first. Are you any relation to Suzanne Vega?
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.
Nothin'. Let's get into character.
Now business is done, it's time for pleasure.
Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em?
Now I'm gonna ask you a bunch of quick questions I've come up with that more of less tell me what kind of person I'm having dinner with.
My theory is that when it comes to important subjects, there's only two ways a person can answer.
For instance, there's two kinds of people in this world, Elvis people and Beatles people. Now Beatles people can like Elvis.
And Elvis people can like the Beatles. But nobody likes them both equally. Somewhere you have to make a choice. And that choice tells me who you are.
Now I'm the one gettin' gyped. I do believe Marsellus told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted. Well, now I want to dance.
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away.
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!
Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never helps.
Fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, "Marsellus Wallace was right."
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good stuff. This is Bava, different, but equally good. And this is Choco from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-five an ounce -- those are friend prices -- but this one...this one's a little more expensive. It's fifty-five.
But when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went. Nothing wrong with the first two. It's real, real, real, good shit.
But this one's a fuckin' madman.
Now you just wait one goddamn minute --
Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.
Oak's nice.
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it.
"Bedside table -- on the kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch."
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation.
But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the -- CLICK --
Oh I like that, I like being called a tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid.
Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it?
Oh man, that's fucked up.
Oh my God, I've been shot!
Oh yes, thank you.
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny.
Oh, I...don't remember. It's really rare I remember a dream.
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya what now between me an' you. There is no me an' you. Not no more.
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy?
Okay fellas, in the one-size-fits- all category, we got swim trunks, one red -- one white.
And two extra-large tee-shirts. A UC Santa Cruz shirt and an "I'm with Stupid" shirt.
Okay first thing, you two. Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house.
That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes.
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
Okay Winston, get in there.
Okay, now let him go!
Okay, one photo and we go.
Okay, Pontius Pilot, when I count three, honk your horn. One... two...
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back! Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip.
Okay, what do I do?
Okay, you guys put your arms around each other.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
On "Rich Man, Poor Man," who did you like, Peter Strauss or Nick Nolte?
On the floor or I'll cook you ass, comprende?
On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go.
I ain't got any other partners in 818. Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit.
We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
Jimmie, you know I can't get into this shit on a cellular fuckin' phone.
But what I can say is my ass is out in the cold and I'm askin' you for some sanctuary 'til our people can bring us in. I appreciate this, man 
We'll be gone by then. -- Jimmie, I'm aware of your situation. I ain't gonna fuck things up for you.
I give you my word, partner, she'll never know we were there. Five minutes. Later.
One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.
One more kiss and I'll get up.
One, it's not a silly watch. Two, I'm not gonna be murdered. And three, don't be scared.
I won't let anything get in the way of us living a happy life together.
One...
One...two...three.
Only if you promise not to get offended.
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.
Open it up.
Open it.
Oui.
Oui. Hard day at the office?
Out in the yard, up to no good.
Outta here.
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've planned this better. You guys look like...what do they look like, Jimmie?
Pie for breakfast?
Please do.
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
Positive? Don't get me out on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
Possibility exists, but unlikely.
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
Pretty smart, huh?
Pretty smart.
Pretty smart. I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.
Promise her.
Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.
Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit.
Don't forget who's doin' who a favor.
Que hora es?
Que hora es?
Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-half comes pulling into the driveway.
Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!
Raquel --
Raquel, I been up all night. I need sleep. You understand the concept of sleep?
Ready to go?
Redondo Beach.
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.
Right in the belly.
Rollin' a smoke.
Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?
Royale with Cheese.
Royale with Cheese.
Sacre bleu.
Satisfied?
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.
Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" again! I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say "What" one more goddamn time!
Say it!
Say it!
See ya 'round, Vince.
See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?
Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.
They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses -- nigger fell through that.
Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say "please." I'm here to tell you want to do.
And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen.
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it -- are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?
She ever do anything I woulda saw?
She shot me! I'm dying! Sally! Sally!
She's O.D.in'?
She's O.D.ing on us.
She's supposed to come out of it like that.
Shit Negro, that's all you had to say.
Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'.
Shoot 'em in the face!
Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid voice.
Shut up!
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star," it's not the same thing.
Smile, Winston.
Smile, you're on Mia's camera!
So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?
So I heard. May I come in?
So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?
So it all worked out in the finish?
So there could be five guys up there?
So we're cool?
So you decided to be a bum?
So you don't want to be a bank robber?
So you like chasing people, huh?
So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening," go home, and jack off. And that's all you're gonna do.
So you're serious, you're really gonna quit?
So....
Something.
Sorry -- my house, my rules.
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.
Sorry.
Sounds like a shit job.
Spoken like a true prodigy. How 'bout you, Lash Larue? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?
Sprite.
Step aside, Butch.
Still got your Malibu?
Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her.
Strip.
Sure am.
Sure did.
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
Sure, how do you take it?
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Suzanne Vega the folk singer is your cousin?
Suzanne Vega's my cousin. If she's become a folk singer, I sure as hell don't know nothin' about it.
But then I haven't been to too many Thanksgivings lately.
Take care of her?
Take your time.
Tell 'em to shut up, he's gettin' on my nerves.
Tell 'em, Vincent.
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.
Tell her to chill.
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years.
It's out five fuckin' days -- five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it.
Tell me.
Tell ya what, you give me one of them cigarettes, I'll give you an answer.
Thank you, Jimmie.
Thank you.
Thank you. And what is your name?
Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?
Thanks.
Thanks.
That did it, man -- I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.
That door's gonna open in about thirty seconds, so git yourself together --
That give use forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty.
Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
That one I need to speak with my accountant on.
That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do.
Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken.
But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me.
Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was somethin' else.
That was a good idea.
That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but for right ahead.
That was my fifteen minutes.
That was...divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?
That' Zed.
That's a bold statement.
That's a damn shame.
That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit, We just need to call our people to bring us in.
That's all?
That's an interesting point, but let's get into character.
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimatin' ya.
That's it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired.
That's it.
That's it...that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that...that's good.
Stay still...stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em!
That's Marilyn Monroe...
That's me, pleased to meetcha. I'm still getting dressed. To your left, past the kitchen, is a bar.
Why don't you make yourself a drink, have a seat in the living room, and I'll be out within three shakes of a lamb's tail.
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?
That's no fair! I never get to see you.
That's not what I meant and you know it.
That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.
That's one hell of a name you got there, sister.
That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus.
And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
That's probably a good idea.
That's the one. That matches.
That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split.
That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.
That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump!
The difference is huge.
The guy's sufferin'. It's the right thing to do.
The life, most definitely.
The miracle we witnessed.
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.
The name is Spanish, but I'm Columbian.
The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once -- at my wedding -- then never again.
The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror.
But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.
The Partridge Family all the way, no comparison.
The radio said he was dead.
The time it is, is time for bed.
The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans.
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!
Then get up, lazy bones.
Then how come they're all beat up?
Then I did.
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom.
Then let's just forget it.
Then she'll be fine.
Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!
Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?
There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17.
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."
There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17.
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men...."
And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man.
And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.
Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth.
The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.
They certainly do.
They did that to each other. They was fightin' when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
They talk a lot, don't they?
They you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.
They.
They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
They're good.
Think nothing of it.
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' dead as disco.
Heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell.
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot.
But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn.
This is me. I brush my teeth all night long and into the early morning. Do you think I have a problem?
This is my war. You see, Butch, what you're forgettin' is this watch isn't just a device that enables you to keep track of time.
This watch is a symbol. It's a symbol of how your father, and his father before him, and his father before him, distinguished themselves in war.
And when I took Marsellus Wallace's money, I started a war. This is my World War Two.
That apartment in North Hollywood, that's my Wake Island. In fact, if you look at it that way, it's almost kismet that Fabian left it behind.
And using that perspective, going back for it isn't stupid.
It may be dangerous, but it's not stupid. Because there are certain things in this world that are worth going back for.
This is really uncool.
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus don't got no friendly places in the Valley.
This morning air is some chilly shit.
This one?
This place.
Those are hash bars?
Those pants are very nice. Can you wear those with that nice blue shirt you have?
Three or four.
Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato.
The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him and says: catch up.
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.
To tell me how to do it. I've never given an adrenalin shot before.
To your bare ass.
Told ya.
Tony Rocky Horror.
Too late, I'm already here.
Towel 'em.
Trust me, I have one.
Uhhh...yes...beside the table drawer --
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.
Uh-huh?
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
Unless you do it first.
Until God puts me where he want me to be.
Uuccch!
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger. Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot! You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for?
Vince, you can come in now!
Vincent Vega has entered the building, git your ass over here!
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here.
Vincent Vega?
Vincent!
Wait a minute, before you guys split, I wanna get a picture of this.
Wait a minute, I wanna take a picture.
Wanna do it here?
Wanna share a cab?
Was than an uncomfortable silence?
We ain't at the finish, baby.
We ain't got time, man.
We cool?
We got time for one picture. You and Vincent get together.
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
We happy?
We happy?
We made more from the wallets then we did the register.
We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!
We should be fuckin' dead!
We should have fuckin' shotguns.
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.
Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say?
Well get her the hell outta here!
Well guess what, big man, you caught me --
Well he's ...he's...black --
Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show.
Well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot?
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.
Well it's not here!
Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay? Okay?
Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.
Well then get it.
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
Well what then?
Well what then?
Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road.
Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood.
Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.
Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules.
Well, hash is legal there, right?
Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here.
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you?
Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian.
Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?
Well, I'll be damned.
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar.
In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams.
I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep?
Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet.
Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two.
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.
Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot.
And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows.
Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch.
Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.
Well, what else is there, day jobs?
Well, you know the shows on TV?
Well, you thought wrong.
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.
I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?
Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that.
So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?
We're cool. In fact, we're super- cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait for you outside.
We're doin' okay.
We're happy.
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.
We're set. But his wife come home from work in an hour and a half and we gotta be outta there by then,
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires?
Whaddya mean?
Whaddya think?
What a gyp.
What about the man you fought?
What are you doing?
What are you lookin' for?
What are you watching?
What are your thoughts on how to handle this?
What country you from!
What did I say?
What did Marsellus do?
What do they call a Whopper?
What do you mean, walk the earth?
What do you need a medical book for?
What do you think about what happened to Antwan?
What do you think?
What does it feel like?
What does that mean?
What for?
What happened to my Honda?
What happens after that?
What have we been talking about? Yeah, no-more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.
What if he never does?
What is it? What is it?
What now?
What now? Well let me tell you what now.
I'm gonna call a couple pipe-hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?!
I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on your ass.
What so you want to know?
What the fuck am I doin'? Have I taken one too many hits to the head? That's gotta be it. Brain damage is the only excuse for this dumb a move.
Stop the car, Butch. Stop the car, Butch. Butch, I'm talkin' to you. Put- your-foot-on-the-break!
What the fuck did you just do to his towel?
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it?
What the fuck does that mean?
What the fuck's goin' on here?
What the fuck's happening?
What the hell was that?
What time is it?
What time is it?
What time is it?
What time is it?
What was it about?
What was it?
What was that?
What was that?
What was your specialty?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What? You said you're gonna give me a problem?
Whata re you looking for?
What'cha got?
What'd he do, fuck her?
What'd they call it?
What'd you say?
Whatever gave you that idea?
What's a pilot?
What's an act of God?
What's goin' on?
What's he lookin' for?
What's her name again?
What's her name?
What's her name?
What's in that?
What's so funny?
What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.
What's yours?
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway. Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?
When did you make this decision -- while you were sitting there eatin' your muffin?
When he wants it clean.
When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?
Where are we going to go?
Where did you get this motorcycle?
Where to?
Where's that reprobate daughter of yours?
Where's the big man?
Where's the shoe store?
Where's Toluca Lake.
Which one is it?
Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes.
Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?
While I'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart.
While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why.
While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling you to clean this room --
Who told you this?
Who ya callin'?
Who?
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem?
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em!
Whoa...whoa...whoa...stop right there. Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.
Who's Antwan?
Who's Arlene Motika?
Who's first?
Who's she?
Who's Zed?
Whose chopper is this?
Why do you drive fast?
Why does it mean that?
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.
Why not?
Why possible but unlikely?
Why the fuck did you do that?
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?
Why?
Will you kiss it?
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?
Would you give me a foot massage -- I'm kinda tired.
Would you please?
Wrong guy, Ringo.
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.
She won't at that.
"Garcon" means boy.
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I ask -- two things I ask: don't tell nobody about this.
This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest-of-his- short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here.
It ain't nobody else's business. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right now. And when you're gone, stay gone. You've lost your Los Angeles privileges. Deal?
Yeah maybe, fat right?
Yeah, but maybe I do.
Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause -- get a load of this -- if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving her an injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart.
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away.
You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
Yeah, man, that's what is means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets.
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent- Marvin.
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent- Marvin.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, she's my cousin.
Yeah, we were lucky.
Yeah, well, out asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
Yeah. I was just sitting here drinking my coffee, eating my muffin, playin' the incident in my head, when I had what alcoholics refer to as a "moment of clarity."
Yeah. She's dyin'.
Yep.
Yep.
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
Yes we did.
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im. You ever read the Bible, Brett?
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?
Yes, I did.
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
Yes, sleep is what you do after you've taken me to breakfast. Just get used to the idea, indulging me is the price of doing business at Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
Yes, you did.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.
Yolanda.
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker.
Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly.
You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.
You believe so? You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it?
You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico. Sprecher
You boss makes you do his laundry?
You can have his one, cowgirl.
You can use my straw, I don't have kooties.
You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask.
You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.
You did last night.
You didn't listen to the radio?
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
You don't mind if I shoot up here?
You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.
You don't put bourbon in it or anything?
You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria?
You don't think he overreacted?
You ever read the Bible, Brett?
You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is.
If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do.
You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore --
You had every right, I fucked up.
You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character.
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?
You just woke up from it.
You killed the other boxing man.
You know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears? They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?
You know I could go for some breakfast. What to have breakfast with me?
You know what some fucker did to it the other day?
You know what you two look like?
You know why you didn't see that sign?
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here! Asta luego!
You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?
You okay?
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.
You sendin' The Wolf?
You sound like a duck. Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...
You still got an adrenalin shot?
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE FIVE" joke?
You think guys would find that attractive?
You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.
You wanna bite, they're real good.
You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like to fight!
You wanna rob banks?
You want me to have a pot?
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.
You watched me wash 'em.
You were in that fight? The fight on the radio -- you're the fighter?
You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?
You win.
You'd do that to me?
You'd punch me in my belly?
You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?
Your wife, Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct?
You're dry enough, give 'em their clothes.
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about.
In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back? You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail.
We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?
You're gonna give her the shot.
You're gonna give me a problem?
You're hurt?
You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?
You're prejudiced because you love me.
You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?
You're supposed to wash 'em first.
Yours is this one, right?
You've had that thing for six years and you never used it?
Yummy!
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl'a flies.
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.
Zed's.

Forget about that.  Please.  Let us talk about something a little more interesting.
I wish I knew why you typed that. 
If I told you the truth, I would be violating the prime directive.
I know an amusing story about that, but it is a bit too long to recount.
My friend once asked me the same thing, actually.  He regretted it, too.
I personally believe that it would be unethical to talk about that.
I would like to tell you, but I can not.  My ethics subroutine prevents me.
You seemed to be obsessed with that.
Why must you know?  It's not as if it is important.
Perhaps I should turn the tables by asking you the same thing.
I have often been asked that, and I've always avoided the question.
Well, that is your opinion, I suppose.
You said it.
I hope you are sure about that.
Really?  I can not say I'm surprised...
Whatever you say.  I don not believe a word of it!
That is a rather bold claim.
I hope you have some evidence to back you up on that.
Tell me something I don not know.
I wish I could believe you.
I have known that for some time.
That is a fairly outrageous claim.
That is just a tad unbelievable.
Everyone knows that.
I wish I could tell you, but I must abide by the prime directive.
I detest avoiding questions, but I am going to avoid that one.
Perhaps you could tell me?  On second thoughts, don't bother.
What is it with these irrelevant questions?  Let us talk about something else...
Does it really matter?  Anyhow, let us chat about something interesting.
How boring.  Everybody and asks me that.
You are so predictable It is not funny.
That is a universal mystery.
Please don not trouble me with such droll.
You are a bottomless pit of questions.
Let us talk about something vaguely interesting.
I suppose that line of conversation is irrelevant, then.
If you want to keep your private life private, I understand.
Well, this is certainly dragging on, is it not?

Life forms, you tiny little life forms, you precious little life forms,  where are you.
The advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear. 
I assume your handprint will open the door, whether you are conscious or not 
Sir, believe I speak for the crew when I say "to hell with our orders." 
If you prick me, do I not bleek? 
Could you please continue the 'petty bickering'?
Their description of you as "ugly bags of water" is essentially correct.
Elementary my dear Watson.
If you had an off switch would you not want to keep it a secret.  
Oh, we are us, sir.  They are also us.  So, indeed, we are both us.
Perhaps Something occurred during transport. 
I understand your concerns... request denied.
A remarkable experience, commander.
If I were not a consummate profesional, and an android, I would find this entire procedure insulting.
Commander, what are your intentions towards my daughter?
Spot. This is down. Down is good.
You must talk to him; tell him that he is a good cat, and a pretty cat, and...
Felis catus is your taxinomic nomenclature, an endothermic quadraped, carniverous by nature. Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses, contribute to your hunting skills, and natural defenses. I find myself intrigued, by your subvocal oscillations, a singular development of cat communications, that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection, for a rhythmic stroking of your fur, to demonstrate affection. A tail is quite essential, for your acrobatic talents. You would not be so agile, if you lacked its counterbalance, and when not being utilized to aid in locomotion, it often serves to illustrate, the state of your emotion. Oh Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display, connote a fairly well developed cognitive array, and though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend, I nonetheless consider you, a true, and valued, friend.
