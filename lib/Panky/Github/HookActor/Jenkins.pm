=head1 SYNOPSIS

This C<HookActor> performs tasks on L<Jenkins|http://jenkins-ci.org> when
certain github hooks are received.

Currently, it can perform jenkins builds on Github Pull Request actions.  In
order for this to work, you must setup a mapping of github repositories to
their respective jenkins jobs.  This can be done in your panky conf like this:

    {
       Github => {
            HookActor => {
                Jenkins => {
                    'user/repo1' => {
                        job => 'Jenkins-Job-Name',
                    },
                    'user/repo2' => {
                        job => 'Other-Jenkins-Job',
                    },
                }
            },
        },
    }

Additionally, your Jenkins jobs need to be set up as a 'parameterized' build,
accepting one parameter called C<HEAD> which accepts the sha1 hash of the commit
that should be tested.  Then, the "Branch Specifier" under the "Git" option
needs to be set to C<${HEAD}> for it to use the parameter we pass in.

That's it!
